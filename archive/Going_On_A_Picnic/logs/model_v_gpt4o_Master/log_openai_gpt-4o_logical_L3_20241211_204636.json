Furthermore, the item's name should not contain any 'double letters,' and its first letter must be a consonant found in the word 'sunshine'. The item's name should not end with a vowel, and must include at least one letter from each of the words 'warm', 'bright', and 'cheerful'. Additionally, the item's name, when spelled backwards, should not form a valid English word, and the item must represent a positive or desirable quality that is abstract and not physically tangible.",
