The key observation is that the words end in \"-ent\" or \"-al\", but more importantly, they seem to have a specific sound quality.\n\nMy FINAL GUESS is that the rule involves words that:\n1. End in \"-ent\" or \"-al\"\n2. Have a soft, flowing sound\n3. Suggest something subtle, transitional, or not fully concrete\n\nSo my final strategic guess will be:\n\n\"resplendent\"\n\nThis word:\n- Ends in \"-ent\"\n- Has a soft, flowing phonetic quality\n- Suggests something luminous and not entirely tangible\n- Follows the pattern of previous allowed words\n\nI believe this captures the essence of the rule I've discerned through the game's progression."
