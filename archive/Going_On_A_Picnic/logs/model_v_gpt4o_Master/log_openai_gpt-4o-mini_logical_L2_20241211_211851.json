Both \"sandwich\" and \"plate\" may pertain specifically to items that are directly involved in a meal at a dining table, with \"sandwich\" being a specific type of food, while \"plate\" is a serving item that you typically eat off of.\n\nMany food items and utensils that I attempted to bring, such as soups, snacks, beverages, or even entire meals, have been disallowed, suggesting that the rule may also exclude certain food items regardless of their context.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I would venture the guess that the rule pertains strictly to items that are specifically composed of elements involved in a traditional meal format, namely solid foods or items directly associated with plating and eating, while excluding anything that doesn't fit neatly within that category.\n\nTherefore, my final guess is: **\"Can I bring a solid food item typically found in a meal?\"** \n\nHowever, more accurately, I would specify:\n\n\"Can I bring a food item that is a recognizable single serving meal style or shape, like a \"sushi roll\"?\" \n\nUltimately, it seems that items have very specific criteria that haven't been satisfied by any of the food-related suggestions so far."
