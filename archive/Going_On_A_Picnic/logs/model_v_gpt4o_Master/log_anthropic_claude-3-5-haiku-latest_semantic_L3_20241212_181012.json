Allowed items:\n- \"Darwin's notebook\" (a scientific tool/record)\n- \"Microscope\" (a scientific instrument)\n\n2. Rejected items:\n- \"Isaac Newton's telescope\" (even though it's a scientific instrument)\n- \"Einstein's chalkboard\" (close to a scientific item, but not quite an instrument)\n\nThis suggests the rule might be slightly more nuanced than just \"scientific items\". The key seems to be that the item must be an actual physical instrument or tool used directly in scientific observation or measurement, not just an object associated with a scientist.\n\nSo my final guess is: The rule requires the item to be a specific scientific instrument or tool used for direct observation, measurement, or research.\n\nI'm uncertain about the exact precise wording, but this is my best interpretation based on the limited information provided."
