Since the examples given were \"pencil\" and \"notebook\", I'm guessing the rule might be related to office/school supplies.\n\n2. If I'm still unsure about the rule after a few more guesses, I'll ask the game master for more examples. Getting additional examples could help me identify the common characteristics or patterns that define the rule.\n\n3. If I feel confident that I've figured out the rule, I'll go ahead and try to guess it. For now, based on the initial examples, my guess is that the rule is related to common office/school supplies.\n\nSo let me start with my new guess: Can I bring a \"book\" to the game?"
