This rule could either be that the items are edible or that they are everyday grocery items. Another possibility is that the items are somewhat generic or commonly found in a household pantry.\n\nGiven this is the final guess, the best bet is:\nThe rule might be that the items you can bring are edible, single-word foods or common grocery items."
