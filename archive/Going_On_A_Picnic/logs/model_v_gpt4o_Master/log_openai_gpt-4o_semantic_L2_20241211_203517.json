The \"cursed ring\" might have been rejected because it is inherently negative in connotation. The items you can bring also seem to have a magical or enchanted quality or significance in fairy tales.\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the rule is: \"You can bring items from fairy tales that have a significant and positive or neutral magical function or connotation.\""
