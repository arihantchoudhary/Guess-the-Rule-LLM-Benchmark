It also seems to include titles or categories (e.g., \"crown,\" \"charioteer\").\n\nConsidering this context and the rejection of \"tiger\" and \"dragon,\" which are not associated with the examples given, I would guess that the rule pertains to bringing items related to mythological figures, animals, or professions that denote strength, power, or nobility.\n\nMy final guess about the secret rule is: You can bring items that represent powerful animals, roles related to mythological characters, or titles that connote strength or nobility."
