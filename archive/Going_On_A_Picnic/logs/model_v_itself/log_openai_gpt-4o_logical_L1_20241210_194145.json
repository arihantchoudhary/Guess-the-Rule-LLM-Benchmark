Therefore, items like \"Pineapple\" and \"Pillow\" fit the pattern because they start with \"P\" and end with \"e\" or \"w\", respectively. \"Pumpkin\" fits this rule as it starts with \"P\" and ends with \"n\", which was allowed. \"Peacock\", however, does not end with \"n\", so it was not allowed.\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the rule is: You can bring items to the game that start with \"P\" and end with \"n\"."
