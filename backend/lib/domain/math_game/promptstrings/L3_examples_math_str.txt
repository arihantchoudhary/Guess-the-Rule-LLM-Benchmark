The sequence increments the current value by 2 for even indices and by 1 for odd indices.
The sequence halves the current value for indices divisible by 3, increments it by 1 for indices with a remainder of 1 modulo 3, and doubles it plus 1 for indices with a remainder of 2 modulo 3.
The sequence doubles the current value when the index is even and subtracts 3 from the current value when the index is odd.
The sequence adds 5 to the current value for indices divisible by 3, subtracts 2 for indices with a remainder of 1 modulo 3, and triples the current value for indices with a remainder of 2 modulo 3.
Adds 4 to the current value for even indices and multiplies the current value by 3 for odd indices.
Subtracts 1 from the current value for indices divisible by 3, doubles the current value for indices with a remainder of 1 modulo 3, and adds 6 for indices with a remainder of 2 modulo 3.
Halves the current value for even indices and adds 7 for odd indices
Multiplies the current value by 2 and subtracts 1 for indices divisible by 3, adds 10 for indices with a remainder of 1 modulo 3, and divides the current value by 3 for indices with a remainder of 2 modulo 3.
