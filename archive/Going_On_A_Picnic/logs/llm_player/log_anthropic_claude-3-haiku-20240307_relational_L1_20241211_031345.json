I'm trying to deduce the pattern based on the examples provided."

Well done!\n\nSome additional examples that fit the rule:\n- \"textbook\" and \"workbook\"\n- \"protractor\" and \"compass\"\n- \"backpack\" and \"lunchbox\"\n\nPlease feel free to provide another guess if you'd like to continue playing."
