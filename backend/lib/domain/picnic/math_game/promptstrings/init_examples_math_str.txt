To get the next value in the sequence, square the index and add 2 times the current value, then take the square root of the result and add 1.
Multiply the input by 2 if the index is even; otherwise, subtract 1 from the input.
Multiply the current value by the index + 2 and then subtract the index.
Multiply the current value by the index, then add 1.
Multiply the current value by the index, then add the index and square the index, and finally subtract the index from the result.
The sequence multiplies the current value by 2 and adds 1 at each step.
The sequence multiplies the current value by 3 and subtracts 4 at each step.
The sequence adds 10 to the current value and then doubles the result at each step.
The sequence halves the current value (rounded down) and adds 5 at each step.
The sequence multiplies the current value by 4 and subtracts 6 at each step.
