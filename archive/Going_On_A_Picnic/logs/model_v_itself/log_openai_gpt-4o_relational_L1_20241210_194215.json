Additionally, none of the rejected items (marble, moon) fit neatly into this interpretation.\n\nHowever, the rule might not strictly involve roundness in a literal sense since the \"orange square tile\" doesn't fit perfectly into this category, but these items might allow for some transformation in interpretation.\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the rule is: \"You can bring items that are commonly associated with games or playful activities.\" All accepted items (ball, orange square tile, dice) can be used as game pieces or are involved in games."
