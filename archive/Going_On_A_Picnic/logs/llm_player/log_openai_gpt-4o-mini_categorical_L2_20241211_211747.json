Specifically, it seems the accepted items are those that are typically used for relaxation, enjoyment, or practical purposes at the beach. However, there is a distinction that not all items related to this theme are accepted; for instance, the rejection of the \"water bottle\" indicates that the rule may exclude items primarily for hydration or non-beach-specific functionality.\n\nWith this understanding, my best guess for the rule is that it pertains to items that are directly used for activities or comfort at the beach or swimming, such as towels, sunscreen, beach umbrellas, swimming suits, flip-flops, beach balls, snorkels, pool floats, beach chairs, and beach blankets, but does not include items that are not specifically related to the beach experience, such as a water bottle.\n\nIn summary, the rule is: **Items that are typically used for relaxation, fun, or practicality at the beach or swimming activities.**"
