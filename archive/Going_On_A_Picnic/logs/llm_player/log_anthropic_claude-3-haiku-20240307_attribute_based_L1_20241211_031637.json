However, the rejection of \"plate\" and \"salad\" suggests that the rule excludes more complex or prepared food items.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the rule is:\n\nYou can bring any single, individual food item that is typically eaten as a snack or part of a meal, but not larger or more complex prepared food dishes.\n\nDoes this accurately capture the rule based on the examples and responses provided by the game master? Please let me know if I have the right understanding of the rule."

Your final guess accurately captured the essence of the rule.\n\nWell done! You successfully guessed the secret rule for the \"Guess the Rule\" game."
