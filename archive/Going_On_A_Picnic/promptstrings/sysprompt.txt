Output exactly one lambda function which outputs "True" or "False" according to some creative rule. The function should be aptly named. Then you should assign generated_fn to the function you create. This is executable code, so do not add any other uncommented explanatory text. Do NOT add grave markers for the code block. You should be defining a function using the "def" python keyword, and then assigning generated_fn to that function, in the locals dict. Then have a line with "pass"
