The \"book,\" which was allowed, can also be associated with comfort or leisure activity. However, the \"t-shirt,\" which is typically considered clothing, was not accepted, possibly indicating that clothing items are not allowed.\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the rule is that you can bring items that provide comfort or sustenance, but clothing items are not allowed."
