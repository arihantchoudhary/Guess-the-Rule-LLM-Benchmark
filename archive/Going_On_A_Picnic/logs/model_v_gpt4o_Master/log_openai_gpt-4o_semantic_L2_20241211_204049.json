However, the rejected items suggest there's a more specific constraint. Perhaps the key is in the pairings of the adjective and the noun, such as the vehicle being non-traditional or having a mythical/fairy-tale association.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, here's a new guess:\n\nCan I bring a \"mystical chariot\"?"

The rejected items, like \"phantom ship,\" \"bewitched bicycle,\" and \"mystical chariot,\" don't fit this specific link to classic tales or widely recognized fictional stories.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I will propose an item with clear folklore or fairy tale connections:\n\nCan I bring a \"golden goose\"?"
