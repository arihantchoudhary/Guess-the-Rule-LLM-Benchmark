Furthermore, the item itself should represent something that can be interactively used by multiple people, and should not require batteries or electricity to function. The item must be a tangible object, and its name should include at least one letter from each of the words 'fun', 'play', and 'laugh'. The item should not be associated with negative actions or outcomes, and its name should not rhyme with any day of the week. Additionally, the item's name, when read in reverse, should not form a valid English word.",

The confirmed items (\"Checkers,\" \"Parcheesi,\" \"Dominoes,\" and \"Mancala\") are all games that can be classified under specific board games or classic games, while the denied items (\"Chess,\" \"Ludo,\" \"Backgammon,\" \"Sorry!\") do not fit in the same category.\n\nFrom this, I will guess that the rule is: **You can bring games that are more focused on luck and simpler strategies rather than those that are heavily based on complex strategy or deep thinking.** \n\nSo, my final guess is that the rule allows for games that involve simpler mechanics and more luck, rather than complex strategic games like chess or backgammon."
