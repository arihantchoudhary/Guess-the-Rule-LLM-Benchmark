They all have a clear \"end\" or \"point\" that can be used for precise manipulation or work.\n\nLet me test this emerging hypothesis strategically.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a Crowbar?\"\n\nReasoning:\n- Crowbar is a tool\n- It has a distinct end/point\n- It's used for leverage and precise mechanical work\n- It's different from previous examples, which will help me test my new theory about the potential rule\n\nMy goal is to see if the Crowbar fits the pattern and provides more insight into the potential underlying rule of the game."

Must be a tool\n2. Must have a clear, purposeful end\n3. Designed for mechanical work or precise manipulation\n4. Typically used for construction, repair, or crafting\n\nThe rule seems to emphasize tools with intentional, functional endpoints that enable specific mechanical interactions, rather than just any tool or pointed object.\n\nThis is my final, most considered interpretation of the potential secret rule."
