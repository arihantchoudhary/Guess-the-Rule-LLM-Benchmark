All allowed items started with G\n2. Allowed items include:\n   - Food items (Grapes, Garlic, Ginger, Guava, Gooseberry, Grapefruit)\n   - Concrete objects (Granite, Gondola)\n3. Rejected item \"Giggle\" breaks this pattern:\n   - It's a verb/abstract noun\n   - Single syllable\n   - Not a tangible object\n\nThe rule seems to require:\n- G as the starting letter\n- Multiple syllables OR being a concrete/tangible noun\n- Likely excluding abstract concepts, verbs, or single-syllable words\n\nThis rule explains why concrete, multi-syllabic G-words like \"Granite\", \"Gondola\", and various foods were permitted, while \"Giggle\" was rejected.\n\nI'm confident this is the most precise interpretation of the observed pattern."
