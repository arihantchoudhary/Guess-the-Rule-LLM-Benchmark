So far, we know:\n- \"Mailbox\" is allowed\n- \"Sunflower\" is allowed\n- \"Letterbox\" is allowed\n\nI notice that \"mailbox\" and \"letterbox\" both relate to receiving mail or letters, and seem to have a similar linguistic structure. However, \"sunflower\" breaks that pattern. So I need a guess that tests multiple potential rule characteristics.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a sunhat?\"\n\nMy reasoning is:\n- It includes \"sun\" like \"sunflower\"\n- It has a compound word structure\n- It introduces a new potential element to test the rule's parameters\n\nThis guess should help me gather more information about what might connect these allowed items."

The test case of \"sunboat\" being rejected supports this nuanced interpretation.\n\nSo my precise rule statement would be: \"Bring a compound word that starts with either 'mail' or 'sun', where the compound is a commonly used or recognizable term in English.\""
