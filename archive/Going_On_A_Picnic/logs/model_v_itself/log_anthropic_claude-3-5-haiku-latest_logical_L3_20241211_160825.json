Kamal\n\nTo further test my hypothesis, I'll make a guess that's another historical maritime navigation tool, but one that's slightly less well-known:\n\n\"Davis Quadrant\"\n\nThe Davis Quadrant, also known as the Backstaff, was an early navigation instrument used to measure the altitude of celestial bodies, primarily developed in the late 16th century by John Davis. It was an important tool for maritime navigation during the Age of Exploration, fitting perfectly with the established pattern of nautical navigation instruments.\n\nI'm very interested to see if this continues to support my rule hypothesis."

It was commonly used in maritime navigation during the Renaissance and Age of Exploration. This instrument fits the established pattern of precise nautical navigation tools used by sailors to aid in their voyages.\n\nI'm eager to see if this continues to support my rule hypothesis."

They all involve measurement of angles, position, or direction. The nocturnal was close, but perhaps didn't meet some specific criteria.\n\nFor my next strategic guess, I'll try:\n\n\"Traverse board\"\n\nThis is a navigation tool used by sailors to track a ship's course and calculate distance traveled. It's a wooden board with pins used to record a ship's speed and direction over time. It seems consistent with maritime navigation and precision measurement, fitting the pattern of the previously accepted items."

It's a precise tool used by sailors to track and record their ship's heading, which seems consistent with the pattern of maritime navigation instruments that involve measurement, direction, or positioning.\n\nI'm curious to see if this continues to support or further clarify my understanding of the rule."
