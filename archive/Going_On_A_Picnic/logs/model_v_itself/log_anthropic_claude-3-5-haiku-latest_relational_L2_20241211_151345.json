Lightning, by contrast, is dangerous and could cause harm. The rule seems to distinguish between passive, observable atmospheric conditions and more active or dangerous phenomena.\n\nThis rule captures the pattern of allowing soft, non-threatening weather experiences while excluding more dangerous or sharp-edged atmospheric events."
