Let me test this hypothesis with a strategic choice that's different but still French.\n\n\"Can I bring a ratatouille?\"\n\nThis is a French savory vegetable dish, different from the previous examples but still distinctly French.

All allowed items are French:\n   - Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e (French dessert)\n   - Foie gras (French savory dish)\n   - Chocolate souffl\u00e9 (French dessert)\n   - Duck confit (French savory dish)\n   - Ratatouille (French vegetable dish)\n\n2. The non-French item (tiramisu, which is Italian) was explicitly not allowed\n\n3. The items span both sweet (desserts) and savory dishes, suggesting the rule is about nationality/origin (French) rather than a specific type of dish\n\nMy hypothesis is that the rule is: \"You can only bring items that are traditional French cuisine or French culinary creations.\""
