Each of the items mentioned are quintessential fantasy and fairy tale elements, indicating that the rule is specifically related to the fantasy/fairy tale theme.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule is:\n\nThe items you can bring to the game must be objects or items that are commonly found in fairy tales and fantasy stories."
