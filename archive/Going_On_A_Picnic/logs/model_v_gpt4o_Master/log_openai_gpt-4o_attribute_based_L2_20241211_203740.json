The rejection of \"shoe\" underscores that there's more to the rule than simply being a four-letter word.\n\nA new guess, taking into account the characteristics of the accepted words, might look for another pattern in their structure. One commonality in the accepted words is that each does not end with the letter \"e,\" unlike \"shoe\" and \"lamp.\"\n\nI will make a new guess based on the structure rule hypothesis:\n\nCan I bring a \"disk\" to the game?"

Additionally, words like \"plant\" were part of the initial examples, potentially as exceptions or to guide the initial understanding, but the consistent pattern from player-submitted items points to the four-letter structure without ending in \"e.\"\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the rule is: You can bring words that have four letters and do not end with the letter \"e.\""
