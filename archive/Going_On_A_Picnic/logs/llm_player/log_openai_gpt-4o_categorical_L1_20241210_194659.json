These are items you might find in a student's backpack or on a desk in a classroom or office. Examples include items like a notebook, pencil, eraser, pen, ruler, calculator, protractor, highlighter, stapler, binder, glue stick, compass, scissors, whiteboard marker, paperclip, and sharpener.\n\nThus, my best guess for the secret rule is that the item must be a common school or office supply used for educational or organizational tasks."
