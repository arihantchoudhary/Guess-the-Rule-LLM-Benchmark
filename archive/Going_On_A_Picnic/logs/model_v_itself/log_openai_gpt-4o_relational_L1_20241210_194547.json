Notably, both \"dog\" and \"cat\" are three-letter words that refer to common household pets. However, words like \"rat\" and \"bat\", which fit this pattern, were rejected, suggesting a more specific rule.\n\nOne distinguishing feature of \"dog\" and \"cat\" is that they both contain a vowel followed by a consonant in the middle, unlike \"cow,\" \"bat,\" or \"rat\" where a consonant follows another consonant or vowel, or the vowel pattern is different. However, this also isn't consistent.\n\nA better guess might involve the more obvious context-based similarity: commonality as household pets or animals typically owned by humans. This rule is more conceptual rather than letter-based.\n\nI would guess that the rule is: \"Words that are common types of household pets, specifically traditional and popular small mammals.\""
