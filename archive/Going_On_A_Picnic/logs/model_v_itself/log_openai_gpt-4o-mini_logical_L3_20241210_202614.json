For instance:\n- A \"backpack\" is used for carrying items, often for school or travel.\n- A \"doorbell\" is a fixture used to signal someone at the door.\n- A \"football\" is a sporting item associated with playing a game.\n- A \"notebook\" is used for writing or taking notes.\n\nTherefore, I would guess that the rule is: **You can bring items that are practical and used in everyday life.**"
