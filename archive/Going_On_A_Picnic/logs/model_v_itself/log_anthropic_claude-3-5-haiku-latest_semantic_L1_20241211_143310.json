A picnic basket suggests outdoor enjoyment and could help me understand if the rule is about broader leisure or outdoor-related items, or if it remains specifically beach-focused.\n\nI'm specifically curious to see if the rule extends beyond strict beach equipment to more general outdoor leisure items."

After carefully analyzing all the allowed items, here's my final rule guess:\n\nThe rule seems to be: \"Items typically used for OUTDOOR LEISURE or RECREATIONAL activities\"\n\nThe evidence supporting this rule includes:\n- Beach-specific items (beach towel, surfboard, beach chair, beach umbrella, beach ball)\n- Water/beach sports equipment (snorkel, flippers)\n- Sun protection items (sunscreen, sunglasses)\n- Outdoor comfort/convenience items (cooler, picnic basket)\n\nWhat unites these items is not just being beach-related, but being things people would use to enjoy leisure time outside - whether at a beach, park, picnic, or other outdoor recreational setting.\n\nThe rule isn't strictly about beaches, but about items that enhance outdoor recreational experiences. The common thread is \"things that make outdoor leisure more comfortable, fun, or enjoyable.\"\n\nMy confidence in this rule is very high, given the systematic testing and consistent pattern across multiple item types. I believe this captures the underlying principle governing what can be brought in the game."
