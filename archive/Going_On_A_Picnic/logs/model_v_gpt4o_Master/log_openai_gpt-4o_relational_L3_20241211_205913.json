The successful guesses all include instruments paired with concertos or significant compositions known for highlighting those instruments, such as violin concertos, clarinet concertos, etc. \n\nHowever, it appears that the rule excludes keyboard instruments like the piano and harpsichord. This might be because, in the context of this game, these instruments are not associated with a single, specific concerto or prominent piece similar to the ones allowed. Additionally, the refusal of the harp suggests that not all classical instruments automatically qualify; instead, it must be an instrument closely associated with a famous concerto or similar work in the realm of classical music.\n\nTherefore, my final guess about the rule is: You can bring a classical musical instrument if there is a well-known concerto or a prominent piece that was specifically composed for it, or prominently features it, and the piece typically highlights that instrument in a solo capacity. Keyboard instruments and possibly certain other instruments are excluded if they are not similarly tied to a distinct, well-known concerto or equivalent work in association with this rule."
