It helps me narrow down the potential rule\n\nMy choice of \"Rose\" is deliberate - it's a clear R-word, but different from the previous examples in type (a flower, unlike the other miscellaneous items), which might reveal more about the rule's complexity."

It's another \"R\" word\n2. It's a different type of item (an animal) from previous examples\n3. It will help confirm if the rule is truly about the first letter \"R\"\n4.

Confirm whether non-R words are consistently not allowed\n2. Provide additional evidence for the \"R\" rule\n3.
