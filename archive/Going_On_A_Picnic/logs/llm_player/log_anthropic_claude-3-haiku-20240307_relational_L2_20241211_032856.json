If not, please let me know the actual rule.\nGame Master: Congratulations! You have correctly guessed the secret rule - the animals mentioned all have a common element in their names. Well done!\nPlayer: Yay, I'm so glad I was able to figure out the secret rule on my final guess! Thank you for playing this \"Guess the Rule\" game with me - it was a fun challenge to try and deduce the pattern based on the examples provided. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to try multiple guesses before revealing the answer. This was a great learning experience!"

I'm impressed that you were able to correctly identify the pattern on your final guess. Figuring out hidden rules based on limited clues requires a lot of analytical thinking, and you demonstrated that skill very well. Congratulations on solving the \"Guess the Rule\" game!"
