By asking about another such object, I'm trying to see if the rule relates to cultural significance, Native American objects, or something about symbolic/spiritual items."

These items are symbolic, have spiritual meaning, and represent cultural heritage.\n\nI want to test if the rule involves cultural artifacts or spiritual symbolism. So I'll ask:\n\n\"Can I bring a Maori tribal mask from New Zealand?\"\n\nThis item is similar to the previous examples in that it's a culturally significant artifact with spiritual/symbolic meaning, but from a different Indigenous culture (Polynesian/Maori instead of Native North American). By asking about this, I can see if the rule is specifically about Native American artifacts or more broadly about culturally meaningful symbolic objects."

However, to further test this hypothesis and gather more information, I'll strategically ask about a different type of culturally significant object:\n\n\"Can I bring a Japanese Noh theater mask?\"\n\nI'm choosing this item because it's another culturally specific artifact with symbolic meaning, but from a completely different cultural tradition (Japanese) compared to the previous Native American and Maori examples. By asking about an item from a different part of the world, I can help determine if the rule is truly about culturally meaningful symbolic artifacts across different cultures, or if there's some more specific characteristic I haven't yet identified."

We were successful with Native American and Maori cultural artifacts (dreamcatcher, totem pole, headdress, tribal mask), but the Japanese Noh theater mask was not allowed.\n\nThis suggests the rule might be more specific than just \"culturally significant artifacts\". There seems to be something unique about the first set of items.\n\nI'll strategically ask about another Indigenous/Native cultural object to further test my hypothesis:\n\n\"Can I bring an Aboriginal Australian didgeridoo?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that this is another Indigenous cultural instrument with spiritual/symbolic significance, from yet another cultural tradition. If this is allowed, it would further support that the rule has something to do with Indigenous or Native cultural artifacts from around the world, with potentially some specific characteristic I'm still trying to pin down.\n\nThe strategic choice is to explore another non-North American Indigenous cultural artifact to see how the rule might be defined."

Allowed items:\n- Dreamcatcher (Native American, traditional, natural materials)\n- Totem pole (Native American, traditional, wood-based)\n- Native American headdress (Native American, traditional, natural materials)\n- Maori tribal mask (Indigenous, traditional, likely natural materials)\n- Aboriginal Australian didgeridoo (Indigenous, traditional, natural wood)\n\n2. Rejected item:\n- Japanese Noh theater mask (not Indigenous/Native, potentially made from different materials)\n\nThe rule seems to require:\n- Cultural origin from Indigenous/Native traditions\n- Symbolic or spiritual significance\n- Likely constructed from natural materials (wood, feathers, etc.)\n- Represents traditional cultural practices\n\nThe commonality appears to be deeply rooted in Indigenous cultural heritage, with artifacts that have profound symbolic meaning and are crafted using traditional methods with natural materials.\n\nThis is my best-reasoned guess based on the provided examples and interactions."
