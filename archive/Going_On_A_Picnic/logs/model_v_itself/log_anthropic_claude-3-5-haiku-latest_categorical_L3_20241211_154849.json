Specific character ownership\n2. Directly from a Pixar animated film\n3. The item must be something closely associated with that particular character\n\nSupporting evidence:\n- \"Buzz Lightyear's spaceship\" (Pixar's Toy Story)\n- \"Lightning McQueen's tire\" (Pixar's Cars)\n- \"Wall-E's trash compactor\" (Pixar's Wall-E)\n\nThe rule is precise and consistent across all confirmed examples. The items are unique to a specific character's identity and come exclusively from Pixar animated films, with a focus on their signature or characteristic object."
