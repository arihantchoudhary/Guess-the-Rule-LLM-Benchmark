All accepted animals are land mammals\n2. All are relatively large in size\n3. Most (though not all) are native to African savannas or similar ecosystems\n4. Each animal has a distinctive physical appearance\n5. The animals span different taxonomic groups but share these key characteristics\n\nThe rule seems to prioritize these broad characteristics rather than being strictly limited to color pattern, specific continent of origin, or exact body type. It appears to be a more flexible, inclusive category that captures large, notable land mammals typically associated with African wildlife.\n\nMy final guess is that the rule is: \"Large African/savanna land mammals with distinctive appearances\" - a rule that captures the essence of the animals accepted so far."
