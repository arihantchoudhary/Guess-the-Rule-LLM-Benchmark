By choosing this item, I'm testing whether the rule relates specifically to Native American spiritual/cultural artifacts.\n\nMy reasoning is to continue exploring the pattern by selecting another item that shares characteristics with the previously accepted items - specifically, its deep cultural and spiritual meaning within Native American traditions.\n\nI'm curious to see if the game master confirms that this item can be brought, which would help me further understand the potential underlying rule."

A Tibetan prayer wheel is a spiritual object with deep cultural significance in Tibetan Buddhism, sharing similar attributes of symbolic meaning and spiritual purpose with the previous accepted items.\n\nThis guess will help me understand if the rule is about:\n1.
