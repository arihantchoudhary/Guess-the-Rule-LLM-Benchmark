These decisions must be significant in interpreting the Constitution or expanding protections of individual rights in specific cases.\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the rule is: \"You can bring documents that are final decisions from landmark U.S. Supreme Court cases that directly address or establish individual legal rights through judicial interpretation or mandates.\""
