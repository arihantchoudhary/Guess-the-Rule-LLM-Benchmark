A playing card seems like a logical next test item.\n\nMy goal is to gather more information about what might connect these items and help me discern the underlying rule."

However, to be more systematic, I'll test an item that is game-related but slightly different.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a game board?\"\n\nMy reasoning is to explore the boundaries of the potential \"game-related items\" rule while introducing a new type of game component that hasn't been mentioned yet. By doing this, I'm trying to either confirm the pattern or gather more data about what distinguishes allowed from disallowed items."

This seems like a strong indication of the rule.\n\nTo further test this hypothesis, I'll ask about an item that's slightly different: \"Can I bring a Rubik's Cube?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that a Rubik's Cube is a puzzle/game item, but not a traditional board or card game component. By choosing this, I'm checking whether the rule is specifically about board/card game items or if it extends to puzzle/game-type objects more broadly. This strategically probes the boundaries of the potential rule while introducing a new type of item."

This new information is crucial. \n\nLet me analyze what I know:\nAllowed items:\n- Chess piece\n- Dice\n- Playing card\n- Game board\n\nNot allowed:\n- Rubik's Cube\n\nMy current hypothesis is that the rule involves game-related items, but there seems to be a nuance I'm missing. The Rubik's Cube rejection suggests it's not just about anything related to games.\n\nI want to test a different type of game-related item to further probe the boundaries of the rule.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a chess timer?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that a chess timer is:\n1. Directly related to games (specifically chess)\n2. A different type of game-related object compared to previous allowed items\n3. Helps me understand if there's a specific subcategory or characteristic I'm missing\n\nThis strategic guess will help me either confirm my current thinking or reveal more about the underlying rule."

Chess piece (used to move on a chessboard)\n  2. Dice (used to determine movement/actions in board games)\n  3. Playing card (used for card games)\n  4. Game board (the playing surface for board games)\n\n- Excluded items:\n  1. Rubik's Cube (a puzzle, not a traditional game piece)\n  2. Chess timer (an accessory/tool, not a piece used to play the game itself)\n\nThe key distinguishing factor seems to be whether the item is a core component directly manipulated during gameplay, rather than just being game-related or a peripheral game accessory.\n\nMy final rule emphasizes physical game pieces that are actively used in the core mechanics of playing traditional board or card games."
