The pattern consistently supports items with good thermal conductivity, and the rule eliminates materials that are thermal insulators.\n\nIf I'm correct, this would explain why metallic and naturally derived materials are allowed, while plastic and ceramic are not.\n\nWould you confirm if this rule matches the secret rule?"
