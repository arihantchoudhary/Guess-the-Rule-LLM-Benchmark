Given the examples of \"pillow\", \"blanket\", and \"comforter\" being allowed, and a sleeping bag being rejected, I want to make a strategic guess that will help me further narrow down the rule.\n\n\"Can I bring a cushion?\"\n\nI chose a cushion because:\n- It's soft like the previously accepted items\n- It's related to comfort and resting\n- It's different enough from the previous examples to help me test my emerging hypothesis about the rule\n- It will help me determine if the rule is about softness, comfort, or something more specific\n\nMy current working hypothesis is that the rule might be about \"soft items used for comfort or resting\", but the sleeping bag rejection suggests there might be a more precise definition."

It seems the rule might be about \"soft items used for INDOOR comfort/rest\" or \"soft indoor comfort accessories\".

The pattern suggests there's something specific about these soft items beyond just being soft or used for comfort.
