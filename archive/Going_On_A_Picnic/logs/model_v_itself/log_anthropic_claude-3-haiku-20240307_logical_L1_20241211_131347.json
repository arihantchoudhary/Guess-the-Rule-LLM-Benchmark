Based on the examples provided and the responses from the game master, it seems the rule might be related to fruits or produce that start with the letter \"M\".\n\nThe game master confirmed that \"Mango\" is allowed, but \"Muffin\" is not. This suggests the rule is specifically about items that are fruits or produce, not just any food item that starts with \"M\".\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule is:\n\nThe rule is that you can bring any fruit or produce item that starts with the letter \"M\"."
