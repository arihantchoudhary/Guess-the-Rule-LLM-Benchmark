Rejected items:\n- \"Lion\" (doesn't start with \"S\")\n- \"Tiger\" (doesn't start with \"S\")\n- \"Whale\" (doesn't start with \"S\")\n- \"Mouse\" (doesn't start with \"S\")\n- \"Pencil\" (doesn't start with \"S\")\n\nThe common thread appears to be that only items starting with the letter \"S\" are allowed in this game. \n\nMy final proposed rule is: \"Only items that start with the letter 'S' can be brought into the game.\"\n\nI'm making this guess confidently based on the pattern of accepted and rejected items, using a systematic process of elimination and observation of the first letter similarity in the confirmed example."
