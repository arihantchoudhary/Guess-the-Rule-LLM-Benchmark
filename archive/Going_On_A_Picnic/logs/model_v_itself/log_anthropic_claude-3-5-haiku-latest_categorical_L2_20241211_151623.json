All items are vegetables/produce\n2. All items grow on vines or above ground (not root vegetables like potatoes or underground vegetables)\n3. The list includes a wide variety of shapes, colors, and types (fruit-like vegetables, elongated vegetables, round vegetables)\n4. All items are edible and commonly found in gardens or produce sections\n\nThe key distinguishing factor seems to be the growing condition - these are all vegetables that grow above ground or on vines, as opposed to root vegetables that grow underground.\n\nI'm confident this rule captures the consistent pattern in the examples provided."
