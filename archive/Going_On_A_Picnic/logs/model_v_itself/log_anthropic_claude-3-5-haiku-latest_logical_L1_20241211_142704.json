The variety of items (musical instruments, vehicles, tools, food, natural phenomena) suggests the first letter is the primary rule.\n\nTo further confirm, I'll test an item that deliberately does NOT start with \"T\":\n\nCan I bring a \"Lamp\"?\n\nMy reasoning is that if this is NOT allowed, it will confirm my \"T-rule\" hypothesis.
