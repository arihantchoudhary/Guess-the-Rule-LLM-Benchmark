In fact, the core rule is simply that the item must be something used in professional photography. The specific word patterns you observed were good observations, but not the underlying rule itself. \n\nThe key is whether the specific item is used in professional photography. So items like \"light diffuser\", \"light stand\", etc., are all used by professional photographers, which is why they were allowed.\n\nCongratulations on solving the rule through systematic investigation and strategic guessing!"
