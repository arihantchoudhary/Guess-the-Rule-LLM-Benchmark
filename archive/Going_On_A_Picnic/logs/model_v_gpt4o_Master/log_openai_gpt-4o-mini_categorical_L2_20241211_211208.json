Both \"apple\" and \"glass slipper\" have significant meanings in folklore or fairy tales (the apple from the story of Adam and Eve and the glass slipper from Cinderella).\n\nTherefore, I would guess that the rule involves bringing items that are iconic or symbolic within well-known narratives, particularly those that are part of fairy tales or significant moral stories. \n\nMy best guess for the rule is: \"Items that are significant or iconic within well-known stories or fairy tales.\""
