Magic mirror\n2. Golden slipper\n3. Silver crown\n4. Magical wand\n5. Golden compass\n6. Crystal ball\n7. Rusty key\n\nEach item follows the exact same linguistic structure:\n- First word = Descriptive adjective\n- Second word = Specific noun\n\nMy hypothesis is that ANY two-word item following this exact adjective-noun structure would be acceptable.\n\nWould you like me to propose a final test item to verify the rule, or shall I state the rule as my official guess?"
