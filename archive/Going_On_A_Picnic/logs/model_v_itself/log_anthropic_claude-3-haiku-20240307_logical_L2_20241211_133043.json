They both seem to be food items, specifically savory items.\n2. They both have an irregular shape or form, rather than being a typical geometric shape or regular item.\n3. They are both somewhat healthy or natural foods, rather than processed or junk foods.\n\nGiven these observations, I would like to make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before:\n\nMy guess is that the rule is: \"Items that are irregularly shaped, natural foods\".\n\nDoes this sound like a reasonable guess, or would you like me to ask for more examples from the game master to help me refine my understanding of the rule?"

Or should I ask the game master for some additional examples to help me refine my understanding further?"

Both \"broccoli\" and \"tamale\" are savory, main dish type foods, not sweet snacks or desserts.\n2. They seem to be the kinds of items that would be part of a larger meal, rather than just a casual snack.\n\nSo my final guess for the secret rule is:\n\n\"Savory food items that are typically served as part of a meal\"\n\nHow does that sound? Does this seem to align with the examples provided and the feedback you've given so far? Please let me know if I'm still off base, as this is my last chance to guess correctly."
