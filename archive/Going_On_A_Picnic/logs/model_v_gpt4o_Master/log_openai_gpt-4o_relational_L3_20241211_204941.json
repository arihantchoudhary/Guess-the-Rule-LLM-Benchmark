The examples given\u2014\"Elder Price\" and \"I Believe\" (from \"The Book of Mormon\"), and \"Elphaba\" and \"Defying Gravity\" (from \"Wicked\")\u2014share a commonality that they are names of characters or songs. However, other attempts, such as using character names or song lines that didn't match exactly with these same musicals, were not allowed, implying that not everything from those musicals fits the rule.\n\nExamining the allowed examples closely, it seems that what \"Elder Price,\" \"I Believe,\" \"Elphaba,\" and \"Defying Gravity\" might have in common is that they are either title characters or songs directly associated with the main characters or pivotal moments related specifically to the main characters within their respective musicals, rather than general elements from the musicals or their titles.\n\nThe rule could be: You can only bring names of lead characters and songs that they sing (or are primarily associated with) from the musicals \"Wicked\" and \"The Book of Mormon.\"\n\nNow, for a final guess, following this logic: Can I bring \"Galinda\" to the game? (as \"Galinda/Glinda\" is a lead character from \"Wicked\")."
