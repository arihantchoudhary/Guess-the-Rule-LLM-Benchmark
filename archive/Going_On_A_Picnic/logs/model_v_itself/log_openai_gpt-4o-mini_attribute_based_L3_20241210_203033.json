The paintings mentioned (like \"Mona Lisa,\" \"Liberty Leading the People,\" and \"The Coronation of Napoleon\") fit this description, while those excluded (like \"The Thinker\" or \"The Girl with a Pearl Earring\") represent either sculptures or different themes that do not align with the proposed focus.\n\nTherefore, my guess for the rule is: \"The items allowed are famous Western paintings representing significant historical, mythological, or religious themes from renowned artists of the European tradition, while sculptures or non-Western representations are not allowed.\""
