This strategic guess might help me understand the subtle distinction in the rule."

The roundness or complexity of shape appears to be the key distinguishing factor.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the secret rule is: \"You can bring items that are fundamentally rectangular in shape.\"\n\nI'm confident this rule captures the subtle pattern in the game master's responses across the various item examples."
