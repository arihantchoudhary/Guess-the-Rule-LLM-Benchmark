The examples include basic arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, and the formula for the area of a circle.\n\nSo, a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before could be: \"2^3\" or \"sin(x)\".\n\nHowever, since I'm still not completely sure about the rule, I think it would be better to ask the game master for more examples first. This could help me better understand the pattern and make a more informed guess.\n\nGame Master, could you please provide a few more examples of items that fit the rule? That would be very helpful in me trying to figure out the secret rule."

The pattern seems to be that the items that fit the rule are mathematical expressions or formulas that involve variables, numbers, and basic arithmetic operations.\n\nSo, my new guess for an item that hasn't been mentioned before and fits the rule is: \"2y + 7\".\n\nGame Master, would this item be allowed under the secret rule?"
