So I'll test another outdoor recreational item with a different form factor.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a soccer ball to the game?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that a soccer ball is also a leisure/sports item used in outdoor settings, similar to the Frisbee. By testing different types of outdoor recreational objects, I hope to detect a pattern or rule that distinguishes allowed from disallowed items.\n\nThe soccer ball represents a different shape and type of item compared to the previous guesses, which might help reveal more about the underlying rule."

Now I have three data points:\n- Frisbee: Allowed \u2713\n- Picnic blanket: Allowed \u2713\n- Beach towel: Not Allowed \u2717\n- Soccer ball: Allowed \u2713\n\nI want to test another outdoor recreational item that might have a different characteristic from the previous ones. I notice that the allowed items so far seem to be used for play or recreation, but they have different shapes and materials.\n\nI'll try: \"Can I bring a baseball?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that a baseball is another sports/recreational item, but it's small, hard, and used in a different context from the previous items. By testing items with varied characteristics, I hope to narrow down the possible rule. The baseball represents a compact, spherical sports object that will help me understand what distinguishes allowed from disallowed items."

I notice the allowed items seem to be somewhat playful or sports-related.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a volleyball?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that:\n1. It's a spherical sports item like the soccer ball and baseball\n2. It's used in recreational play\n3. It has a different size and material from the previous allowed items\n4. By systematically testing different types of recreational/sports objects, I hope to clarify the rule\n\nThis guess will help me understand if the rule relates to sports/play items, spherical objects, or some other characteristic that I might not have identified yet."

The picnic blanket seems to be an anomaly that suggests there might be a slight variation or additional criterion I haven't fully identified.\n\nIf I'm close but not exactly right, I believe the rule is very closely related to sports balls or spherical play objects.\n\nI'm confident this rule explains most of the allowed/disallowed items, even if it may not be 100% precise."
