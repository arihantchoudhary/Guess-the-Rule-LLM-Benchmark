The confirmation of \"eclair\" further supports my hypothesis about the rule potentially being related to French pastries/breads. \n\nTo test this theory further, I'll make a strategic guess that is slightly different: \n\n\"Can I bring a macaron to the game?\"\n\nA macaron is another classic French pastry, but distinctly different from the previous bread/pastry examples. This will help me narrow down whether the rule is specifically about French pastries, or if there might be another underlying characteristic."

The consistent thread appears to be their French cultural connection.\n\nMy Final Rule Guess: The rule is that you can bring any French food item to the game.\n\nI'm confident this captures the pattern demonstrated in the examples, as each item shared the clear characteristic of being a traditional French food."
