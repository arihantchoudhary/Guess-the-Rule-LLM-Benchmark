The rule seems to be related to magical or fantastical items. \n\n2. The items seem to be associated with mythical creatures like unicorns and fairies.\n\n3. They also seem to be rare or unusual items, not everyday objects.\n\nGiven that, I will make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before:\n\n\"Phoenix feather\"\n\nThis is another magical, fantastical item associated with a mythical creature - the phoenix. It fits the pattern of the previous examples.\n\nDoes this new guess match the rule, Game Master? If not, could you please provide a few more examples to help me better understand the secret rule?"
