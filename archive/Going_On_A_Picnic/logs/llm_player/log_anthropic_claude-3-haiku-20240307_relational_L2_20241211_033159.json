And the one example that was disallowed - penguin - does not fit this rule since it is a bird that lives near the water but not primarily in it.\n\nDoes the game master confirm that my guess of the rule is correct?\n\nIf so, I'm ready to move on to a new round with a different rule. If not, I'll ask the game master for some additional examples to help me refine my understanding of the rule."
