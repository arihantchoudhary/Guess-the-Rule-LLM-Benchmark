The examples provided are a \"Frisbee\" and a \"picnic blanket\", which suggests this might be a rule about items typically associated with outdoor leisure or recreational activities.\n\nMy best guess for the secret rule is: \"Things you might bring to a park or outdoor recreational area\"\n\nThe reasoning:\n- A Frisbee is a classic item played with outdoors\n- A picnic blanket is used for sitting outside, typically at parks or picnic areas\n- Both items are lightweight, portable, and used in open-air recreational settings\n\nThis rule seems to capture the essence of the given examples, suggesting a category related to outdoor leisure items or equipment one might bring to enjoy time outside."
