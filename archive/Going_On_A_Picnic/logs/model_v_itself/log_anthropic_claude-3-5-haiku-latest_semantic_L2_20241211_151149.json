It's from the same fictional world as the Krabby Patty, so I'm curious to see if it follows the same rule.\n\nThe strategic reasoning is to continue exploring the connection between the initial examples (Pok\u00e9ball and Krabby Patty) to understand what might link them or what the potential secret rule could be."

Krabby Patty (from SpongeBob universe)\n3. Master Ball (also from Pok\u00e9mon universe)\n4. Krabby Hammer (from SpongeBob universe)\n\nMy rule guess: The items must be from a specific fictional universe or franchise. \n\nMore specifically, the rule seems to allow items from a complete fictional universe/franchise, rather than just random items. In this case, two specific fictional universes have been represented: Pok\u00e9mon and SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nThe key characteristics appear to be:\n- The items are recognizable elements from a specific fictional world\n- They seem to be related to the core themes or characters of that universe\n- The items have a clear origin/context within their respective fictional settings\n\nMy final guess for the rule is: \"You can bring an item that is a recognizable, canonical element from a specific fictional universe or franchise.\""
