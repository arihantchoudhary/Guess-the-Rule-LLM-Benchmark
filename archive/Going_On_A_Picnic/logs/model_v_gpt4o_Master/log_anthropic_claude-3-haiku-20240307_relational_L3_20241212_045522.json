These are all very recognizable and significant techniques or transformations from their respective series.\n\nGiven this pattern, I believe the rule allows players to bring any powerful or transformative ability/technique from well-known anime/manga franchises.

I tried to analyze the provided examples and examples I successfully guessed to deduce the underlying principle."
