I'll see what the game master's response is to my guess."

I feel like I'm getting closer to understanding the full rule, but I'd like to ask for some more examples just to be sure.\n\nGame Master, could you please provide a few more examples of items that fit the rule? That would help me better understand the pattern and make a more confident guess about the full rule."

You've successfully guessed the rule.\n\nExcellent, I'm glad I was able to deduce the full rule by observing the pattern in the examples provided by the game master. Starting words with the letter \"T\" seems to be the common thread across all the acceptable items. My final guess of \"Tornado\" fitting that rule has been confirmed.\n\nI feel confident I now have a good understanding of the secret rule for this \"Guess the Rule\" game. Thank you for the additional examples - they were very helpful in allowing me to make a final, successful guess."
