This suggests that the words fitting the rule might have to end in a specific sound or pattern. Notably, the approved words all end in a \"-unk\" or \"-ud\" sound.

The words \"plunk,\" \"thud,\" and \"clunk\" are allowed, while others like \"brunch,\" \"drunk,\" \"chunk,\" \"blink,\" and \"skunk\" are not. A key observation here is that all the allowed words have an \"l\" as the second letter: \n\n- \"plunk\" (p*l*unk)\n- \"thud\" (t*h*ud)\n- \"clunk\" (c*l*unk)\n\nThis suggests that the rule might be that the second letter of the word must be \"l\". \n\nSo, my best guess for the rule is: \"The word must have 'l' as the second letter.\""
