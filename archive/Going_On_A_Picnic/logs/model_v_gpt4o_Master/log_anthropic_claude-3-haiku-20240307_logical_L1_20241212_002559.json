The items seem to be related to food or drinks, as my initial guess suggested.\n2. However, the rejected items, \"Milk\" and \"Honey\", don't seem to fit a clear pattern based on physical state or consistency.\n\nGiven this, I think I would like to ask the game master for more examples to help me better understand the rule. \n\nGame Master, could you please provide a few more examples of items that are allowed under the rule?
