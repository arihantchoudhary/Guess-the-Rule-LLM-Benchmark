These both seem to be fantasy/fairy tale themed items.\n\n2. Since the rule has not been explicitly stated, I don't want to just guess randomly. I think it would be better to ask for more examples first to get a better sense of the pattern.\n\n3. I will ask the game master for another example:\n\n\"Okay, based on the examples you've provided so far of 'glass slipper' and 'magic wand', can I bring a 'golden egg' to the game?\"\n\nThis will give me another data point to try to discern the underlying rule. Asking for more examples is a safer approach than guessing blindly at this stage."
