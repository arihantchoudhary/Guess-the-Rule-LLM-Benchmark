These allowed items seem to share something beyond just being food. Let me try another strategic guess to test my hypothesis.\n\n\"Can I bring a croissant?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that all the allowed items so far are:\n1. Prepared/processed foods\n2. With a specific shape or form\n3. Likely from cuisine/culinary traditions\n4. Not a simple, raw fruit/vegetable\n\nA croissant fits these potential characteristics. It's a specific baked good with a distinct shape, from French cuisine, and is a processed food item.\n\nI'm choosing this carefully to help me understand the underlying rule without repeating previous guesses."

It seems like the items that are allowed might be related to their shape or form. Specifically, I suspect the rule might be about items that are curved or have a curved/rolled shape.\n\nTo test this theory, I'll ask about another item that has a curved or rolled characteristic:\n\n\"Can I bring a wrap?\"\n\nBy choosing a wrap, I'm looking to see if the curved/rolled shape is indeed part of the rule. It's similar to a sushi roll in being a rolled food item, which fits my current hypothesis about curved/cylindrical shapes."

The curvature or rolling appears to be the key distinguishing characteristic.\n\nMy confident final guess: \"You can bring items that have a curved or rolled shape.\""
