When the player guessed \"crow\" (a bird), it was rejected. When they guessed \"spider\" (which is an arachnid, not technically an insect but still an arthropod), it was accepted. \n\nTherefore, my best guess for the secret rule is that you can bring items that are either insects or arthropods but cannot bring birds or other unrelated items."
