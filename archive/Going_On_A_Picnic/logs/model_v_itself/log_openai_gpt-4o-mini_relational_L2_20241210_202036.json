The provided examples, \"apple\" and \"avocado,\" are both fruits that can be associated with being commonly found in salads or eaten raw. \n\nThe fruits that were guessed: \"banana,\" \"kiwi,\" \"grape,\" \"peach,\" \"plum,\" and \"lime,\" have all been rejected. \n\nConsidering this trend and the types of fruits mentioned, I will guess that the rule may be that the items allowed must be fruits that have multiple seeds or can have a significant fleshy part. Both \"apple\" and \"avocado\" have a high flesh content and seeds. \n\nTherefore, my guess for the rule is: **\"You can only bring fruits that have a core or a central seed structure (such as apples and avocados), while others like bananas and grapes do not fit that pattern.\"**"
