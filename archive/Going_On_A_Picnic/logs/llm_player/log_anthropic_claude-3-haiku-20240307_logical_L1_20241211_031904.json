The only guess that was denied was \"Rhino\", which does not start with 'R'.\n\n3. Based on this pattern, it seems the secret rule is that the items must start with the letter 'R'.\n\n4.

The denial of \"Robot\" reinforces that the secret rule is that the items must start with the letter 'R'. I believe I have successfully guessed the rule."
