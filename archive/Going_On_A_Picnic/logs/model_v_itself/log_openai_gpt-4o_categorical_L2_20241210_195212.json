The examples and all the guesses that were affirmed\u2014\"yoga mat,\" \"yoga blocks,\" \"yoga strap,\" \"yoga towel,\" \"yoga wheel,\" and \"yoga bolster\"\u2014are all items associated with yoga practice. Therefore, my best guess is that the rule is that the items must be yoga-related accessories or equipment."
