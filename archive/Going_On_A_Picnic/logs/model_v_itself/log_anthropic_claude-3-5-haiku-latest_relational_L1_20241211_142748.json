Is a different type of object from the apple, wagon, and ball\n3.

By testing a non-red item of the same type as a previously accepted item (pencil), I can gain more insight into the potential rule.\n\nThis strategic approach continues to methodically explore the potential dimensions of the rule while minimizing redundant guesses."

We know a red wagon was previously accepted\n2. We know a blue pencil was not accepted\n3. This guess tests whether the color red is the critical factor or if there's another hidden rule about wagons\n\nI'm strategically trying to isolate whether the requirement is specifically about the color or if there's another underlying pattern. If a blue wagon is not accepted, it would further support the hypothesis that the rule is color-related.\n\nThis approach continues our methodical exploration of the potential rule dimensions while introducing a new combination that hasn't been previously tested."

It's a completely different type of object than previous red items (apple, wagon, ball, pencil)\n2. It maintains the \"red\" characteristic of all previously accepted items\n3. It will help confirm whether the rule is truly just about having a red item\n\nThis guess continues our systematic exploration of the rule while introducing a novel object type.

Rejected items:\n- Yellow ball\n- Blue pencil\n- Blue wagon\n\nThe rule appears to have two key characteristics:\n- Color is the critical factor\n- The color must specifically be red\n- The type/category of object does not matter\n\nMy testing strategy progressively:\n- Confirmed the color requirement\n- Ruled out other colors\n- Tested multiple object types to ensure the rule was not object-specific\n\nI'm confident that \"You can bring any item that is red\" captures the game master's secret rule with a high degree of certainty."
