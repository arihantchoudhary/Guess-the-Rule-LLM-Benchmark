All items so far have been food items that can be eaten\n2. The items have been diverse:\n   - Different types of foods (grain, fruits, vegetables)\n   - Different colors\n   - Different shapes\n   - Different food categories (bread, fruits, root vegetables)\n\nThe consistent thread connecting all allowed items is that they are edible/food items. Each example provided or tested (bread, apples, orange, banana, carrot, potato) is something humans can consume as food.\n\nI believe the key characteristic is simply that the item must be something that can be eaten by humans. This would explain the wide variety of allowed items across different food groups and types.\n\nSo my final guess for the rule is: \"You can bring any edible item to the game.\""
