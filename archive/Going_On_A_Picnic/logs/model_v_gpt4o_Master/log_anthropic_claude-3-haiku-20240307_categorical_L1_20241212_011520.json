I will make a new guess that has not been mentioned before, to try to discern the actual rule:\n\n\"Can I bring a book?\"\n\nA book is a non-food, non-beverage item, so it will be interesting to see if the game master allows it or not.

The disallowed item, the book, does not fit this pattern as it is a durable, non-consumable item.\n\nTo test this rule further, I will make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before:\n\n\"Can I bring paper towels?\"\n\nPaper towels are a consumable household item, so if my understanding of the rule is correct, the game master should confirm that I can bring them.\n\nCould you please provide the game master's response to my \"paper towels\" guess?"

The game master's confirmations that I could bring items like tissues and paper towels reinforced this conclusion.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule is:\n\nThe items allowed are consumable or disposable household items."
