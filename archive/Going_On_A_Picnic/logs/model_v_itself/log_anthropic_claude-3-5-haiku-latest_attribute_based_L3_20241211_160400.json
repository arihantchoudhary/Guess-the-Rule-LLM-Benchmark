The item must reference a song title\n2. The item must have a specific geometric shape\n\nTo test this theory, I'll propose: \"Happy\" circular lemon tarts\n\nThis item follows my hypothesis because:\n- \"Happy\" is a song by Pharrell Williams (song title reference)\n- The item is circular (a specific geometric shape)\n\nI'm curious to see if the game master will confirm or deny this item."
