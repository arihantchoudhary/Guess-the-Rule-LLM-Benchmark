My previous hypothesis about the pattern seems incorrect since \"HORSE\" was not allowed, even though it shared multiple characteristics with the example words \"ROSE\" and \"HIDDEN\".\n\nLet me take a different strategic approach. I'll choose a word that's quite different from the previous examples to test a new potential rule.\n\nCan I bring the word \"CHAOS\"?\n\nMy reasoning:\n- It's 5 letters long (like previous examples)\n- Has an unusual letter combination\n- Contains some similar letters like \"H\" and \"O\"\n- Strategically different from previous guesses\n\nI'm hoping this will help me understand more about the secret rule by seeing how the game master responds to a distinctly different word."
