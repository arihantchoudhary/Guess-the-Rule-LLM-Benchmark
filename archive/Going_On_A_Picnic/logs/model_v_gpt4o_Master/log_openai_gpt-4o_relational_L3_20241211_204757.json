The word \"wave,\" which was allowed, also shares the two letters \"av\" with \"patriot's\" and \"grave,\" aligning with this pattern.\n\nThe secret rule might involve words containing the letter sequence \"av.\" Therefore, my best guess for the rule is: *Words that contain the sequence \"av\" in them can be brought to the game.*"
