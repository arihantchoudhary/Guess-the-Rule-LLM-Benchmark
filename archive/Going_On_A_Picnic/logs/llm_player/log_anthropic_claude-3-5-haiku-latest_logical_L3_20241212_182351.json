The only two allowed items share the characteristics of being:\n   - Related to flying/air movement\n   - Both start with the same letter: \"F\" (Frisbee) or \"K\" (Kite)\n\n2. Given the previous rejections of various flying objects, the most consistent pattern seems to be the initial letter \"K\".\n\n3. The allowed items represent specific types of recreational flying objects that start with \"K\".\n\nTherefore, my final guess is that the secret rule is: \"You can bring a flying toy/recreational object that starts with the letter 'K'.\""
