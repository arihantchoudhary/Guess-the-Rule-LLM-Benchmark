Instead, it might involve the category or context that these words fall into.\n\nOne potential pattern could be that each of these items fits within the context of the board game \"Clue\" (or \"Cluedo\"), where a thimble, a hotel, and a candlestick could conceptually fit as items related to rooms, characters, or objects involved in the game.\n\nBased on this, I'll make a new guess:\n\nCan I bring \"revolver\" to the game?"
