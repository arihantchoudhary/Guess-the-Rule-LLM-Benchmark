Accepted items so far:\n- Miranda warning card (a legal procedural document)\n- Brown v. Board of Education textbook (a landmark Supreme Court case)\n- Supreme Court decision document (a legal judicial record)\n- Constitutional amendment text (a foundational legal document)\n\n2. All these items share a common theme of being connected to law, legal processes, court systems, or constitutional matters.\n\n3. The rule seems to require the item to have a substantive connection to legal/judicial topics, not just a superficial or tangential relationship.\n\nMy guess represents what appears to be a consistent underlying pattern across the accepted examples - a focus on legal and judicial documentary or reference materials."
