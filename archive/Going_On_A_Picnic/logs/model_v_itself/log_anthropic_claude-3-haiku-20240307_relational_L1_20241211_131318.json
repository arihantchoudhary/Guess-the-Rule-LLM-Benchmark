Based on the examples provided by the game master, it seems that the secret rule is:\n\nThe items must be a pair of the same type of object, and the objects must share a common color.\n\nIn the first example, the pair is \"red apples\" and \"red cherries\" - both are types of fruit and they share the color red.\n\nIn the second example, the pair is \"blue towels\" and \"blue blankets\" - both are types of fabric and they share the color blue.\n\nSo, my best guess for the secret rule is that the items must be a pair of the same type of object, and the objects must share a common color."
