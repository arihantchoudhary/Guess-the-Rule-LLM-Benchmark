The allowed juices seem to be mostly common fruits, and the pies are also common fruit varieties. However, the rule isn't simply about fruit types.\n\nI want to test a new hypothesis. I'll ask:\n\n\"Can I bring lemonade?\"\n\nMy reasoning is to explore whether the rule might be related to the form of the drink or the specificity of the liquid. Lemonade is a different type of drink from the previous examples, so this will help me understand if there are additional constraints on what can be brought to the game. The strategic approach is to test a new beverage that doesn't exactly match previous allowed items."

Pies with a single fruit name as a modifier (apple pie, cherry pie, berry pie, blueberry pie)\n2. Generic \"juice\"\n3. Juices with a single fruit name as a modifier (grape juice, apple juice, peach juice, pear juice, watermelon juice)\n\nThe rule specifically excludes:\n1. Items with \"orange\" in the name\n2. Sodas with a fruit name\n3. Juices with less common fruit names (like apricot)\n4. Other drinks like lemonade\n\nThe key seems to be:\n- Single fruit modifier is okay\n- No \"orange\"\n- Must be a pie or juice type item\n- Must use a relatively common fruit name\n\nThis rule explains why \"apple pie\" is allowed, but \"apple soda\" is not; why \"grape juice\" is allowed, but \"grape soda\" is not; and why \"orange juice\" is specifically prohibited."
