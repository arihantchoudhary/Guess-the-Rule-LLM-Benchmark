If this is accepted, it would further confirm my hypothesis about the rule being specifically about Native American cultural artifacts.\n\nIf the game master confirms I can bring the ceremonial drum, I'll feel even more certain about the rule.

However, to be even more strategic, I'll ask about an item that is slightly different but still connected to Native American culture:\n\n\"Can I bring a Navajo blanket?\"\n\nThis item is a traditional textile with deep cultural significance, created by the Navajo people. It represents a specific tribal craft and cultural artifact, which aligns perfectly with the pattern we've seen so far. By asking about a specific type of cultural artifact, I'm hoping to further confirm or potentially refine my understanding of the rule.\n\nThe choice of a Navajo blanket is deliberate - it's a tangible cultural object that goes beyond spiritual artifacts and instead focuses on traditional craftsmanship, which could help me understand if the rule is broader than just spiritual items."

The items represent diverse aspects of Native American culture, including spiritual practices, artistic craftsmanship, and traditional symbolic objects.\n\nMy rule emphasizes that the common thread is the Native American cultural origin and traditional significance of the items, rather than a narrower subcategory like only spiritual items or only crafts."
