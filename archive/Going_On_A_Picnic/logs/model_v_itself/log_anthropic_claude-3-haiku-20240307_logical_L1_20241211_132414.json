Perhaps the rule is more broad, encompassing beverages or liquids in general.\n\nPlayer: Can I bring \"Soda\" to the game?\n\nGame Master: Yes, you can bring \"Soda\" to the game.\n\nAh I see, the rule seems to be about items that are consumable or drinkable. The examples of \"Hamburger\", \"Honey\", \"Water\", and \"Soda\" all fit this broader category.\n\nPlayer: Okay, got it. My new guess for the rule is:\n\n\"Items that are consumable or drinkable.\"\n\nGame Master: Correct! That's the rule. Well done."
