However, broader categories like \"renewable energy sources\" and \"renewable energy technologies\" do not fit the rule, nor do items like \"energy storage systems\" or \"carbon capture systems,\" which, while related to renewable energy, do not directly produce or convert renewable energy.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule is: **Specific technologies or systems that directly produce or convert renewable energy.**"
