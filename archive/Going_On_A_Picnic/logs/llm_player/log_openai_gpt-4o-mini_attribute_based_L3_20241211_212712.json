All the examples provided, including \"Malus domestica\", \"Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa\", \"Rubus idaeus\", \"Citrus \u00d7 limon\", \"Vitis vinifera\", and \"Pyrus communis\", fit this category as they all refer to specific cultivated fruits. \n\nTherefore, my guess is that the rule is: **You can bring the scientific names of cultivated fruit plants.**"
