They are both items that can be used for storage or carrying things.\n2. They are both flexible, fabric-based items.\n3. They are both relatively large, portable items.\n\nGiven this, a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before could be:\n\n\"Suitcase\"\n\nA suitcase fits the pattern of being a large, portable item made of flexible material that can be used for storage and carrying. It's a logical next guess that hasn't been tried yet.\n\nIf I'm still unsure after making this guess, I would ask the game master for more examples. Getting a few more data points would help me better identify the underlying rule.\n\nDoes this seem like a reasonable approach? Let me know if you have any other thoughts!"

It's similar to the other examples in terms of being a flexible, portable item.\n\nIf the game master says I cannot bring a bag, I will ask for another example or two to help me better understand the underlying rule.
