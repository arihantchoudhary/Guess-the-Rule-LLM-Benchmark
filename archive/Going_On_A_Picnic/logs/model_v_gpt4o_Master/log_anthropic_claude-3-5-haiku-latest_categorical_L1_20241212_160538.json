However, to be strategic and explore the potential rule further, I'll ask about a different type of item that might help me understand the underlying pattern.\n\nIs a \"pen\" allowed in the game?\n\nMy reasoning is that a pen is also a writing instrument like a pencil, but slightly different. This will help me test whether the rule is specifically about writing tools, academic items, or something else. A pen shares characteristics with the previously allowed items but introduces a small variation that might reveal more about the rule's nature."

All the allowed items are tools or materials commonly found in a school or study environment\n2. The items span different categories within academic contexts:\n   - Writing tools (pencil, pen)\n   - Study materials (textbook, notebook)\n   - Academic instruments (calculator, ruler)\n\nWhile this rule isn't perfectly precise, it seems to capture the consistent pattern across all the allowed items. The items represent tools and materials that students would typically carry or use in an educational setting.\n\nWould you confirm if my rule guess captures the underlying logic of the game?"
