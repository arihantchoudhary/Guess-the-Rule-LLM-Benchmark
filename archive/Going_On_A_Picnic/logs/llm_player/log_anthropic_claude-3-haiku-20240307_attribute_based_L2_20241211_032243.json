These items seem to have some common characteristics that could hint at the underlying rule.\n\nGiven the context of a game called \"Guess the Rule Games\", I would guess that the rule is:\n\nThe items must be objects commonly associated with or used in games.\n\nThe examples of \"dice\" and \"chess pieces\" are both classic game pieces or components, so this seems to fit the pattern.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule is:\n\nThe items must be objects that are commonly used in games.\n\nHow's that? Does my guess accurately capture the rule that the game master has in mind? Please let me know if I'm on the right track or if I need to rethink my approach."
