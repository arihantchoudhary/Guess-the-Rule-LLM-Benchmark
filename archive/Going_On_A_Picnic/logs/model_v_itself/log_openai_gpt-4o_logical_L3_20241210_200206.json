It's possible that the rule might involve a specific pattern or characteristic that \"crisp\" has that \"clap\" and \"craft\" do not. Since the current guesses have not been successful, it might be strategic to ask for more examples to better understand the rule.\n\nPlayer: Could you please provide more examples of items that I can bring to the game?"

Both \"crisp\" and \"sunlit\" contain a combination of vowels where the first vowel is \"i\" and the second vowel is \"u\". The rejected words do not follow this pattern. Therefore, my best guess for the rule is: You can bring words that contain the vowels \"i\" followed by \"u\"."
