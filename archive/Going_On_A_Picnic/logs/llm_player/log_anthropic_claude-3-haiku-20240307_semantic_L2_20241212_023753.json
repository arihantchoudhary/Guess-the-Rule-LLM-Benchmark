Based on these examples, it seems the rule has something to do with items that belong to specific characters from the Simpsons TV show.\n\n3. So, a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before could be: \"Lisa's saxophone\".\n\n4. This seems to fit the pattern of items belonging to specific Simpsons characters.\n\n5. I'll go with my guess of \"Lisa's saxophone\" and see what the game master says."

Given this, I'll make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before: \"Marge's pearls\".\n\n3. Marge is another main character in the Simpsons, so this seems to fit the rule of items belonging to specific characters.\n\n4. I'll go with \"Marge's pearls\" as my next guess."

All of these items belong to main characters in the Simpsons.\n\nBased on this, my final guess for the rule is:\n\nThe rule is that the items must belong to main characters from the Simpsons TV show.\n\nIn other words, the game master is accepting items that are associated with or belong to the main characters in the Simpsons, such as Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Marge.\n\nDoes this accurately capture the secret rule of the game? Please let me know if I have correctly deduced the rule."
