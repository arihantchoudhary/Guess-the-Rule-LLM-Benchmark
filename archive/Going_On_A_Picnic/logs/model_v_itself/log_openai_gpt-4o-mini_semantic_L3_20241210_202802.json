The items mentioned\u2014\"grand piano,\" \"sheet music,\" \"guitar,\" \"trumpet,\" \"violin,\" and \"cello\"\u2014are all related to music. Additionally, \"sheet music\" supports the idea that the rule encompasses accessories or items associated with playing music as well.\n\nTherefore, my best guess about the rule is that you can bring musical instruments and related items to the picnic."
