Both \"basket\" and \"cheese\" fit this rule, as do \"beetle,\" \"bubble,\" \"biscuit,\" and \"bracelet.\" The word \"blueberry\" also fits this rule as it contains two 'b's. Therefore, my best guess for the rule is: You can bring an item to the game if it contains exactly two occurrences of the letter 'b'."
