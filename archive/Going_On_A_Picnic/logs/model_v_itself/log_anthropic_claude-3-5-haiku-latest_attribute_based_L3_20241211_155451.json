All accepted words (PANE, TALE, LAKE, MANE, CAPE, BANE) are 4 letters long\n2. Each word starts with a different consonant\n3. Each word contains the letter A\n4. Each word's letters progress strictly alphabetically from left to right (P-A-N-E, T-A-L-E, L-A-K-E, M-A-N-E, C-A-P-E, B-A-N-E)\n5. Rejected words like RACE and FACE violated the strict alphabetical progression rule\n\nThe key insights came from systematically testing different word combinations and carefully observing the pattern of accepted and rejected words. The alphabetical progression requirement is the most crucial and nuanced aspect of the rule.\n\nMy final answer: the rule requires a 4-letter word starting with a consonant, containing A, with letters strictly ascending alphabetically from left to right."
