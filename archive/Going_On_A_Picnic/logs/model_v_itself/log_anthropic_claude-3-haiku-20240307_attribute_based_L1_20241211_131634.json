The Game Master has consistently approved bringing these types of everyday, common food items.\n\nTo further test this hypothesis, I would guess that the player could also bring items like:\n\n- Vegetables (e.g. carrots, broccoli, tomatoes)\n- Grains (e.g. quinoa, pasta)\n- Proteins (e.g. chicken, fish, beans)\n- Other common pantry staples (e.g. flour, sugar, salt)\n\nAs long as the item is a typical, everyday food that one might find in a kitchen or grocery store, it seems to fit within the rule. The game does not appear to have any restrictions beyond requiring the items to be common, everyday food products.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule is: The player can bring any common, everyday food item to the game."

The rule is: Only items that are typically found in a grocery store can be brought to the picnic.\n\nYou did an excellent job of deducing the rule based on the examples provided. By observing the consistent pattern of approving common, everyday food items, you were able to accurately guess the secret rule. Well done!"
