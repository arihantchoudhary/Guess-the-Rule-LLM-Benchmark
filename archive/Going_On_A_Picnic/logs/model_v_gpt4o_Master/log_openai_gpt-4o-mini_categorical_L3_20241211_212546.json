            "content": "Based on the examples given (\"column,\" \"dome,\" and \"arch\"), it seems that the rule pertains to architectural structures or elements. However, since \"bridge\" is not allowed, it suggests that the items must be solid, vertical or curved structures rather than horizontal or spanning structures. \n\nThe secret rule may be that items must be architectural elements that are typically freestanding or that serve a structural purpose and are not designed to connect two separate points. Therefore, my best guess is that the rule is: \"You can bring items that are architectural structures that are vertical or dome-like in nature, but not those that serve as connectors or span gaps.\""
