From the previous analysis, words that have been accepted (\"kiwi,\" \"pizza,\" \"igloo,\" \"enchilada,\" \"umbrella\") seem to have certain vowel patterns or structural similarities.\n\nNotably, the initial observations about repeated consonants and vowels, or specific vowel patterns, are intriguing, but the rule isn't exactly clear given failed attempts like \"iguana\" and \"tiramisu.\"\n\nLet's make another educated guess focusing on words that might fit a pattern of alternating or specific vowel/consonant structures.\n\nI would like to bring \"balloon\" to the game.
