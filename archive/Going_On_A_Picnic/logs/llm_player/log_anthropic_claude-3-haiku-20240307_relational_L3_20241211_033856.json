The rule is: Pairs of items can be brought to the picnic if they both belong to the same color category, with one being a fruit or vegetable and the other being a famous fictional character known for that color.\n\nWell done in deducing the secret rule. You've demonstrated a clear understanding of the pattern presented in the examples. I'm impressed by your logical reasoning and attention to detail. Feel free to provide another item combination to test the rule further."
