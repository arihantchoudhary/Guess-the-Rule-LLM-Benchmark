Glass slippers are famously associated with the story of Cinderella, while a magic mirror is a common trope in fairy tales and fantasy stories.\n\nSo my best guess for the secret rule in this \"Guess the Rule\" game is that the acceptable items must be related to fairy tale, fantasy, or magical elements. Items that fit this theme would be allowed, while more mundane or non-fantastical items would not be accepted.\n\nDoes this seem like a reasonable guess for the secret rule based on the information provided? I'm trying to make my final guess as accurate as possible given the limited clues."
