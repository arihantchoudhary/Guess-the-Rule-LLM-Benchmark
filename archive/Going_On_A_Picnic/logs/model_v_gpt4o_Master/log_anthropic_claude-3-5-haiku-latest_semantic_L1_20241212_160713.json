However, I want to test whether the rule is more specific than just \"beach items\". I'll try an item that is beach-related but slightly different:\n\n\"Can I bring a snorkel?\"\n\nMy reasoning:\n- It's beach/water sports equipment\n- Continues the theme of beach/outdoor recreation\n- Tests whether the rule is specifically about recreational beach items\n- Provides another data point to help narrow down the potential rule\n\nGame Master, can I bring a snorkel?"

They represent different categories of beach-related equipment and accessories.\n\nThe rule appears to be broad enough to include:\n- Personal protection items (sunscreen)\n- Recreation equipment (surfboard, beach ball, snorkel)\n- Sun/shade accessories (beach umbrella)\n- Personal comfort items (beach towel)\n\nThe common thread is their strong connection to beach/outdoor recreational contexts.\n\nI'm confident this is the most likely rule based on the consistent pattern of successful items across different types of beach-related objects."
