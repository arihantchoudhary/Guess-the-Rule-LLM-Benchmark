Specifically:\n- First letter is uppercase\n- Middle letter is lowercase\n- Last letter is uppercase\n\nSo my current hypothesis for the rule would be: Words/inputs must follow a capitalization pattern of: First letter uppercase, middle letter lowercase, last letter uppercase.\n\nHowever, with only two examples, I cannot be completely certain of this rule. More examples would help confirm or refine the hypothesis."
