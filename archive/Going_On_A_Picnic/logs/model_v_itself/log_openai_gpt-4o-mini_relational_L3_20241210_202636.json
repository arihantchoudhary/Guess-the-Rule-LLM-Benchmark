Given that \"Dream\" likely refers to the \"I Have a Dream\" speech, and \"Freedom\" is a common term related to his work, my guess is that the rule might be related to significant concepts or elements from that specific context of his messaging.\n\nTherefore, I guess the rule is: \"Items must be significant elements or terms explicitly associated with Martin Luther King Jr.'s messages or related civil rights actions that do not encompass mere abstract values.\""
