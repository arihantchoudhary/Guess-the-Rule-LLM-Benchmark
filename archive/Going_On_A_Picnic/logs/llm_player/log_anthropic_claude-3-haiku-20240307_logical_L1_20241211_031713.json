Household items or common objects\n\nI'll go with option 1 and make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before:\n\n\"Can I bring a Tote Bag to the game?\"\n\nA tote bag seems to fit the pattern of items that can be used for carrying or holding things, like the basket example.

The rule seems to be related to items that are used for carrying, holding, or containing things, as both the \"Basket\" and the \"Picnic Basket\" fit this pattern.\n\n2. The rule may also involve common household or everyday items, as both \"Blanket\" and \"Picnic Basket\" are fairly typical household objects.\n\nGiven this, my next guess that hasn't been mentioned before would be:\n\n\"Can I bring a Cooler to the game?\"\n\nA cooler is a common household item that can be used for carrying and containing things, similar to the basket and picnic basket examples. Let's see if the game master confirms this as an acceptable item."

Items that are used for carrying, holding, or containing things\n2. Common household or everyday items\n\nWith that in mind, my next guess that hasn't been mentioned before is:\n\n\"Can I bring a Storage Box to the game?\"\n\nA storage box seems to fit the pattern of being a common household item that can be used for containing and holding things, similar to the accepted examples.
