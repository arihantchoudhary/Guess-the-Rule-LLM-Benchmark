However, the refusal of \"towel\" suggests that not all items related to yoga or fitness are allowed. \n\nGiven the examples, my best guess for the rule is that you can bring items that are specifically used during a yoga practice or class. Therefore, the items must be related to yoga exercises or routines. \n\nSo my final guess is: \"You can bring items specifically used for yoga practice.\""
