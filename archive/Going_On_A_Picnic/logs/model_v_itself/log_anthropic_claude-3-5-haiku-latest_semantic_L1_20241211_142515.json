However, I want to test a slightly different type of item to see if the rule is truly about water activities or if there might be another underlying pattern.\n\nI'll propose:\n\"Scuba mask\"\n\nMy reasoning is that this item is closely related to water activities, similar to the snorkel and swim fins, but different enough to help me further understand the potential rule. If this is allowed, it would reinforce the water/beach equipment theme.\n\nWould the scuba mask be allowed in the game?"

Beach towel (beach accessory)\n2. Surfboard (water sport equipment)\n3. Snorkel (swimming/diving equipment)\n4. Swim fins (swimming/water sport equipment)\n5. Wetsuit (water activity clothing)\n6. Scuba mask (diving equipment)\n\nAll these items are directly connected to water-based activities, suggesting a rule that encompasses beach and water-related gear. The rule seems to focus on equipment used for swimming, surfing, diving, or other ocean/beach-related pursuits.\n\nI'm quite confident that items which are used in water environments or for water activities would be allowed in the game, while items not related to water or beach activities would likely be rejected."
