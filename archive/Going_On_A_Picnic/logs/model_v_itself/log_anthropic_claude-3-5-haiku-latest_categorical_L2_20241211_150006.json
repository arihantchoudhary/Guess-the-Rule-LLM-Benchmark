All the items mentioned so far are fundamental components typically found in baking recipes or kitchen pantries.\n\nMy rationale:\n- Flour: A staple baking ingredient used in breads, cakes, pastries\n- Eggs: Essential for binding, rising, and adding structure in baking\n- Sugar: A key sweetener in most baked goods\n- Milk: A liquid ingredient used in many baking and cooking recipes\n\nThese items are all basic ingredients that would be found in a baker's kitchen and are used to create various culinary preparations. My final guess is that the secret rule is about allowing items that are core baking/cooking ingredients."
