My successful guesses of \"key\" and \"kettle\", both of which start with \"K\"\n\nI'm confident this is the underlying rule of the game, as all allowed items consistently begin with the letter \"K\".\n\nMy final guess is: The rule is that only items starting with the letter \"K\" are permitted in the game."
