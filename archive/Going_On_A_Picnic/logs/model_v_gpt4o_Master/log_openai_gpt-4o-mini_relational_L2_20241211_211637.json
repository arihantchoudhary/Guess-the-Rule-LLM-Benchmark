In contrast, the guesses of \"scrambled eggs,\" \"muffins,\" \"bagels,\" \"milk,\" and \"tea\" were not permitted, suggesting that while breakfast items are allowed, there are specific restrictions on the types or categories of those items.\n\nTherefore, my best guess about the rule is:\n\n**You can bring breakfast foods or beverages that are typically served in a diner or caf\u00e9 setting, but not items that are more commonly associated with meals other than breakfast.**"
