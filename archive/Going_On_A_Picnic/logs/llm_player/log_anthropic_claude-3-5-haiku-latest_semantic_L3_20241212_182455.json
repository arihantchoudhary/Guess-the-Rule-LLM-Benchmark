Confirmed items: \n   - Saxophone (starts with S)\n   - Trumpet (starts with T)\n   - Clarinet (starts with C)\n   - Piano (starts with P)\n\n2. Rejected items:\n   - Guitar (starts with G)\n   - Marimba (starts with M)\n\nThe pattern suggests that musical instruments starting with letters N-Z are not allowed, while those starting with A-M are permitted. This rule elegantly explains why the diverse set of confirmed instruments (woodwind, brass, keyboard/percussion) were all accepted, while guitar and marimba were rejected.\n\nThis is my final, most confident guess about the secret rule."
