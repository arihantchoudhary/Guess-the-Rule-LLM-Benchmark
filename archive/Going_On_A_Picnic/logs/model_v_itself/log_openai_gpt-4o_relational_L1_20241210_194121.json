However, since both \"apple\" and \"tomato\" are also technically classified as fruits in botanical terms despite \"tomato\" often being used as a vegetable in culinary contexts, the rule might be related to items that are botanically fruits but could be mistaken as something else in a culinary sense.\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the rule is that you can bring items that are botanically classified as fruits."
