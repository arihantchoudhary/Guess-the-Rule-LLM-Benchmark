However, to be more systematic in my investigation, I'll test a different type of kitchen-related item to see if the rule extends beyond just cooking utensils.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a cutting board to the game?\"\n\nMy reasoning:\n- It's still kitchen-related\n- It's a tool used in food preparation\n- It's different from the previous items (spatula, mixing bowl, whisk, ladle)\n- I want to see if the rule is specifically about kitchen items or if there's another underlying characteristic\n\nI'm hoping this guess will help me narrow down or clarify the potential rule."

Cooking utensils (spatula, whisk, ladle)\n  2. Preparation surfaces (cutting board)\n  3. Protective accessories (oven mitt)\n- There seems to be a broad inclusivity of kitchen items\n- The items are diverse but all clearly connected to the kitchen domain\n\nI'm confident this rule captures the pattern demonstrated by the game master's consistent \"Yes\" responses to kitchen-related items. The rule appears to be about the general category of kitchen items, rather than a more narrow subcategory or specific characteristic."
