This might include things typically associated with visual elements or effects in photographs, such as subjects commonly in photos (\"child\"), techniques or features of photos (\"blurred background,\" \"black and white filter\"), or objects within a specific context in photos (\"protest sign\"). Therefore, the rule might involve elements commonly captured or used in photographic contexts, especially those affecting how an image is perceived or interpreted."
