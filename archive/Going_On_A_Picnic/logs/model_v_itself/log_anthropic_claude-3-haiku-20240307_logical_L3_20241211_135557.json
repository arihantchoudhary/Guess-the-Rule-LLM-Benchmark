If the game master says it's incorrect, I will ask for more examples to try to better understand the criteria for the rule.\n\nDoes this sound like a good approach?

            "content": "Okay, based on the examples provided - \"Yo-yo\" and \"Frisbee\" - as well as the fact that a soccer ball was not allowed but a Frisbee was, I believe the secret rule is:\n\nThe items that are allowed are portable, hand-held toys or recreational items that can be thrown or tossed.\n\nThe key characteristics seem to be:\n\n1) Portable and hand-held size - So larger items like a basketball or football may not be allowed.\n\n2) Toys or recreational items - Not just any random object, but things intended for play and entertainment.\n\n3) Can be thrown or tossed - The items have a dynamic, interactive quality where they can be propelled through the air.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule is:\n\n\"You can bring portable, hand-held toys or recreational items that can be thrown or tossed.\"\n\nDoes this accurately capture the pattern and criteria that the game master has provided so far? Please let me know if I'm on the right track or if I'm missing something in my understanding of the rule."
