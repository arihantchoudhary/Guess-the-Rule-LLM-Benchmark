The item's name should contain more consonants than vowels and must describe a quality associated with scenic beauty. Additionally, the name of the item must not contain the letters 'x' or 'z' and must start with a letter found in the word 'environment'. The item itself should be intangible, representing an appreciable quality of nature. Finally, the name of the item, when spelled backward, must not form another valid English word, and the name, when each of its letters is converted to its numeric value in the alphabet and added up, must yield a prime number.",
