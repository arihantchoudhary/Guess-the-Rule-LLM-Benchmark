You successfully deduced the rule through the examples provided. All of the paintings you guessed - the Mona Lisa, Winged Victory of Samothrace, The Starry Night, The Birth of Venus, The Persistence of Memory, and The Starry Night Over the Rhone - are indeed famous works housed in the Louvre museum. Your final guess of \"Famous Paintings\" captures the essence of the rule. Congratulations on figuring it out!"
