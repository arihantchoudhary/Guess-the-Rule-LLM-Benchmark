Both a \"veil\" and a \"bouquet\" are traditionally linked to weddings, with the veil being a part of the bride's attire and the bouquet being a floral arrangement typically carried by the bride or used as decoration. \n\nMy best guess for the secret rule is: \"Items that are typically associated with weddings or bridal accessories.\""
