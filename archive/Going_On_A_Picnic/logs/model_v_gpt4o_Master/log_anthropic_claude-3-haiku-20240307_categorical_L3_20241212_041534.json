They are advanced, futuristic tools that are commonly associated with those science fiction universes.\n\nSo my final guess for the secret rule in this \"Guess the Rule\" game is that the allowed items must be recognizable as fictional, technological devices or tools from popular science fiction or fantasy franchises."
