The item itself should be associated with joy and celebration, and its name should not contain any 'double letters.' Additionally, the name of the item, when its individual letters are rearranged, should form the name of a color. The item must be something that can be performed by a group of people and does not require any additional equipment or props. Finally, the name of the item must include at least one letter from each of the words 'music', 'rhythm', and 'movement'.",
