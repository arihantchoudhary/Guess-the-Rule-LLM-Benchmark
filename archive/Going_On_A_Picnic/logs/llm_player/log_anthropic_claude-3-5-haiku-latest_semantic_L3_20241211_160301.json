Include a person's name\n2. Represent a principle, theory, concept, or significant work\n3. Are abstract/conceptual rather than physical objects\n4. Typically come from intellectual domains like philosophy, science, or theoretical frameworks\n\nThe confirmed examples that support this rule include:\n- Plato's Republic\n- Occam's Razor\n- Newton's Third Law\n- Einstein's Theory of Relativity\n- Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat\n- Aristotle's Metaphysics\n- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\n- Darwin's Theory of Evolution\n\nEach example follows this precise pattern of being a named, person-associated conceptual work or principle."
