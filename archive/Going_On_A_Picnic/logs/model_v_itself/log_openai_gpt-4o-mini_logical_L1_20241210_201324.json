However, since my previous guess about only allowing items that start with \"Qu\" was incorrect, I need to think deeper about what these items might have in common aside from their beginning sounds.\n\nUpon further inspection, all the provided items are nouns that consist of two or more syllables, and they share a similar phonetic structure. It's also worth noting that they can all be categorized as either food items or concepts/qualifiers.\n\nFrom this understanding, my best guess for the rule is that you can bring items that are two or more syllables long and start with \"Qu.\""
