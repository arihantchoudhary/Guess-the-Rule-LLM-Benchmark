Both approved items have a double consonant sound within their names: \"soccer\" with 'cc' and \"racket\" with 'ck.' Meanwhile, neither \"basketball\" nor \"volleyball\" maintains this pattern with their consonant structures.\n\nGiven these observations, I would guess that the rule may be that the items must contain a double consonant sound or combination within their names.\n\n**Final guess: The rule is that you can bring any sports-related item whose name contains a double consonant.**"
