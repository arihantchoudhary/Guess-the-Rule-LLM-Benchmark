The item must not be a living entity, and its name should include at least one letter from each of the words 'fun', 'laugh', and 'joy'. Additionally, the name of the item, when spelled backward, should not form a valid English word, and the item should evoke a sense of amusement or entertainment. Finally, the item must be something that is light enough to be carried by a child and does not need electricity or batteries to function.",
