However, since bread is also allowed, which isn't dairy-related, the rule might be broader.\n\nOne possible rule could be: You can bring staple food items or items commonly found in a standard kitchen/pantry. These are basic food essentials that you would typically have on hand.\n\nThis is my best guess for the rule."
