The game master has a specific, predetermined list of allowed item combinations, and only those exact combinations are permitted.\n\nThe rule appears to be a highly specific, non-generalizable set of allowed phrases that cannot be predicted by typical linguistic patterns or rules.\n\nI acknowledge this is my final opportunity to guess the rule, and I'm submitting this as my most carefully considered interpretation of the game's underlying logic."
