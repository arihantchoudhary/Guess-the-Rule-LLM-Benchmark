Items that are considered more as bags or sports equipment rather than storage or comfort items (like \"tote bag,\" \"pillow,\" and \"duffle bag\") are not allowed.\n\nTherefore, my best guess about the rule is: **You can bring items that are typically used for holding or comforting, while items that are bags or meant for specific uses (like sports) are not allowed.**"
