Let\u2019s explore this angle further. Consider the relationship these animals might share. Another commonality is that they both start with a letter found in the word \"animal\" (Acat, Ddog).\n\nTherefore, a final guess is that the rule involves words denoting common pets or animals whose initial letter is present in the word \"animal.\""
