Let me try to summarize the rule:\n\nThe rule seems to be that you can bring any item that is commonly associated with outdoor summer activities or the beach.\n\nDoes that sound correct? If so, I'd like to make one more guess to confirm:\n\nCan I bring a beach chair to the game?\nGame Master: Yes, you can bring a beach chair.\n\nExcellent, based on all the examples provided, I believe I have successfully guessed the rule. The rule is that you can bring any item that is commonly associated with outdoor summer activities or the beach."
