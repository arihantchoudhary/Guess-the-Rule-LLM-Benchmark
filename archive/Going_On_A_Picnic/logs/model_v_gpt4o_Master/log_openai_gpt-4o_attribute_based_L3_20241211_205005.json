Given that, let's test this hypothesis with another word associated with light:\n\nCan I bring \"Glow\" to the game?"

Another possibility we could explore is the presence of certain letters or letter patterns. \n\nLet's examine the examples:\n- \"Halo\" starts with an \"H\" and ends with an \"o\".\n- \"Firework\" starts with an \"F\" and ends with a \"k\".\n\nPerhaps we need to look for a new pattern that hasn't been considered before, such as the words starting with uppercase letters and ending with lowercase letters. All the attempts so far started with uppercase and ended with lowercase, so they don't conform to this pattern specifically. \n\nTrying a word that starts with an \"H\" and ends with an \"o\" like \"Halo\" could possibly work, but I also want to check if this is about having different starting and ending letters.\n\nLet's make a new guess: Can I bring \"Hero\" to the game?"

            "content": "Based on the final successful guess with \"Hero\" and earlier examples \"Halo\" and \"Firework,\" it seems like the rule might be that the word must start with a specific letter or pattern and end with a specific one. \n\nBoth \"Halo\" and \"Hero\" start with \"H\" and end with \"o,\" while \"Firework\" does not follow that pattern but was still allowed, which suggests the pattern could be unrelated to just matching starting or ending letters.\n\nWhat is more likely is that the rule requires words to contain a vowel sandwich, where vowels encircle consonants in the middle. Let\u2019s test this with the two words \"Halo\" (H-a-l-o) and \"Hero\" (H-e-r-o), where a consonant, L or R, is sandwiched between vowel pairs.\n\nThus, my best guess is that the rule is: The word needs to have a pattern where two vowels surround a consonant within the word (a consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel (CVCV) structure)."
