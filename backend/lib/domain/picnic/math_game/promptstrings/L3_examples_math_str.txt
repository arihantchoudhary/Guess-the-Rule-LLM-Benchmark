The sequence adds the square of the index to the current value for even indices and adds half of the index (rounded down) for odd indices.
The sequence adds the square of the index plus the index itself for indices divisible by 3, subtracts the index for indices with a remainder of 1 modulo 3, and adds the index for indices with a remainder of 2 modulo 3.
Adds the cube of the index to the current value for even indices and adds 2 * index^2 - index for odd indices.
Subtracts index^2 - 3 * index from the current value for indices divisible by 3, adds the cube of the index for indices with a remainder of 1 modulo 3, and adds 2 * index + 5 for indices with a remainder of 2 modulo 3.
Adds index^2 + index^3 to the current value for even indices and subtracts the index plus 3 * index^2 for odd indices.
Adds index^2 - index^3 to the current value for indices divisible by 3, adds 2 * index^2 + 5 * index for indices with a remainder of 1 modulo 3, and subtracts 3 * index^3 - index for indices with a remainder of 2 modulo 3.
