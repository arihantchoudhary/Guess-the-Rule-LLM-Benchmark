There might be a common theme or category these items belong to, which isn't immediately clear.\n\nBefore making another guess, it would be strategic to gather more information.

More specifically, these are words that consist of two individual words combined together to form a new word. Each part of the compound word can stand alone as a meaningful word. For instance, \"sand\" and \"box,\" \"drum\" and \"stick,\" \"hatch\" and \"back,\" \"note\" and \"book.\"\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the rule is that you can bring items that are compound words, where both parts of the word can exist as separate English words."
