It begins with an \"M\" sound, like Microphone, Megaphone\n2. It's not a sound amplification device, which will help me understand if the rule is about the first letter/sound\n3.

Stage is related to public speaking/performance (like Podium)\n2. It's a physical platform for communication\n3. It involves projection and visibility\n4.
