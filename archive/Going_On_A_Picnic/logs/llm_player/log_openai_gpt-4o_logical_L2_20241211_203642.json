Let's see how this fits: \n\n- \"banana\" has three syllables and is allowed.\n- \"potato\" has three syllables and is allowed.\n- \"tomato\" has three syllables and is allowed.\n- \"avocado\" has four syllables and is not allowed.\n- \"cucumber\" has three syllables and is not allowed. (This presents a potential inconsistency unless there are other factors at play.)\n- \"carrot\" has two syllables and is not allowed.\n\nGiven this pattern, my guess for the rule is that you can only bring items with three syllables in their name."
