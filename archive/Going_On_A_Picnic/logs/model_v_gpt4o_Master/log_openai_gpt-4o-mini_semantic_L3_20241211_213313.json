In contrast, the rejected items (clown nose, bucket hat, feather boa, beanie, trucker hat) tend to be either playful, casual, or not typically regarded as stylish headwear.\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the secret rule is: **You can bring items that are considered formal or stylish hats, while casual or playful headwear is not allowed.**"
