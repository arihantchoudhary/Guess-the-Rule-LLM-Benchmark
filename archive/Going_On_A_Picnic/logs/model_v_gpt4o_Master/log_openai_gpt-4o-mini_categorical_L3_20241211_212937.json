More specifically, they could possibly be items that can either evoke a sensory response or be interactive in some way. \n\nSome of them are playful or whimsical, like \"chocolate\" and \"a marshmallow,\" while others serve practical or functional purposes, like \"a rope\" and \"a shock generator.\" \n\nHowever, a key detail is that the items so far have varied greatly in category\u2014ranging from food items to toys and tools\u2014which suggests that the items may also be associated with various forms of play or creativity. \n\nWith this in mind, my best guess at the rule is: \"The items you can bring are all physical objects that can be interacted with or used in whimsical, playful, or practical contexts.\""
