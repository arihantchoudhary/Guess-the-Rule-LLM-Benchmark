The first word might describe a location or general category, and the second word might specify a specific part or component within that category.\n\nHowever, with only two examples, I cannot be completely certain of the precise rule. More examples would help confirm or refine my hypothesis.\n\nMy best guess of the rule: Create compound items by combining two related words with a hyphen, with the first word providing context and the second word specifying a specific part or element."
