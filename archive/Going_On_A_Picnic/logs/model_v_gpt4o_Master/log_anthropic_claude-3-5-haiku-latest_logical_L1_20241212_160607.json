Quiche (a physical food item)\n  2. Quarterback (a living person/role)\n  3. Quokka (a living animal)\n  4. Quill (a physical writing instrument)\n\n- Rejected items:\n  1. Qantas (an airline/organization)\n  2. Quadrilateral (an abstract geometric concept)\n\nThe key distinguishing factor appears to be whether the \"Q\" item is a concrete, physical entity that can be physically brought to the game, rather than just starting with \"Q\".\n\nSo my final rule guess is: \"Bring a tangible 'Q' item that is either a living being or a physical object, but not an abstract concept or organizational entity.\""
