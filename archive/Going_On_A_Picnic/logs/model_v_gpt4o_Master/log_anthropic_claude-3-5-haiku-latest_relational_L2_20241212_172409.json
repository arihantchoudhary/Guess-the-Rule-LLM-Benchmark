I'll choose a different genre and era to see if it follows the pattern:\n\n\"Aretha Franklin\" and \"Respect\"\n\nThis example purposely uses:\n- A different musical genre (Soul/R&B)\n- A different era (1960s)\n- A very famous artist and her signature song\n\nMy goal is to see if this unique example also fits the apparent rule."
