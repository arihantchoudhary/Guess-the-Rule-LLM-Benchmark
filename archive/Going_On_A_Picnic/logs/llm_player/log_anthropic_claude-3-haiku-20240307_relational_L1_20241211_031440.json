The game master has provided three examples that fit the secret rule: \"red apples\", \"blue jeans\", and \"yellow lemons\".\n\n2. Based on these examples, it seems like the rule might have something to do with the color of the items. The items are all a single color - red, blue, and yellow.\n\n3. To test this hypothesis, I will make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before, but still follows the color pattern:\n\"green grapes\"\n\nGame Master, can I bring \"green grapes\" to the game?"
