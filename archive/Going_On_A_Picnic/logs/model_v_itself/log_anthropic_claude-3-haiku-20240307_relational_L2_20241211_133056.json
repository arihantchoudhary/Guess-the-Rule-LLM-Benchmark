In other words, they must contain the same letters, just rearranged.\n\nThe Game Master rejected my guess of \"race\", which is also an anagram of the previous examples. This suggests the rule is more specific than just \"anagrams\".\n\nAfter analyzing the examples more closely, I notice that all the words are 3 or 4 letters long, and they are all common English words.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the rule is:\n\nThe items must be anagrams of each other, and they must be 3 or 4 letter common English words.\n\nDoes this sound like an accurate guess of the secret rule? I believe this rule covers all the examples provided, and explains why \"race\" was rejected."
