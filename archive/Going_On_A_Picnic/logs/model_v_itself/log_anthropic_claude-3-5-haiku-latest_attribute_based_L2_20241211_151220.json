My next strategic probe will test if non-celestial shapes are also allowed.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a heart-shaped cookie?\"\n\nMy reasoning:\n1. Previous successful items have included both celestial references and shape variations\n2. I want to test if the shape itself is part of the rule, independent of the celestial theme\n3. A heart shape is distinctly different from star/moon shapes\n4. It maintains the \"cookie\" category from previous successful items\n\nThis guess will help clarify whether it's:\n- Celestial references specifically\n- Interesting/unique shapes\n- Something else entirely\n\nI'm looking to gather more information to narrow down the potential rule."

Based on the successful items so far, which include:\n- Star-shaped cookies\n- Moon cake\n- Star fruit\n- Moon-shaped cookie\n\nAnd the unsuccessful guess of a heart-shaped cookie, I'm now strongly suspecting the rule involves CELESTIAL/ASTRONOMICAL REFERENCES.\n\nMy next strategic probe will be: \"Can I bring a star-shaped cake?\"\n\nReasoning:\n1. It maintains the celestial reference (\"star\")\n2. It varies the item type from previous guesses (now a cake instead of cookies)\n3. It tests whether the \"star shape\" aspect is consistent\n4. It's a novel combination not yet tried\n\nThis guess will help me further explore:\n- Whether celestial references are key\n- If shape matters when the celestial reference is present\n- If different item types can still fit the rule\n\nI'm deliberately constructing a guess that systematically tests potential rule components while introducing a new variation."

All successful items include either \"star\" or \"moon\" in their name/description\n2. The unsuccessful guess (heart-shaped cookie) did not have a celestial reference\n3. The celestial reference appears more important than the specific shape or type of item\n4. The celestial term could appear in the name or be inherent to the item's characteristics\n\nThe rule seems to prioritize the astronomical/celestial connection over other attributes like shape or food type. Whether the item is a fruit, cookie, or cake doesn't matter, but it must have a clear stellar or lunar association.\n\nMy final, confident guess is that the rule requires an ASTRONOMICAL/CELESTIAL REFERENCE in the item."
