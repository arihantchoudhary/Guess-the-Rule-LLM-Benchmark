The item itself should be associated with joy and celebration, and its name should not contain any 'double letters.' Additionally, the name of the item, when its individual letters are rearranged, should form the name of a color. The item must be something that can be performed by a group of people and does not require any additional equipment or props. Finally, the name of the item must include at least one letter from each of the words 'music', 'rhythm', and 'movement'.",

Only the original examples \"samba\" and \"salsa\" have been confirmed as allowed\n2. Both are Latin dance/music genres\n3. Both start with \"s\"\n4. Attempts with other dance genres (\"tango\", \"swing\") were rejected\n5. My guess is that the specificity is around these exact two words, not a broader category\n\nMy strategy throughout was to systematically test different possibilities:\n- First, I explored if it was broadly about dance/music genres\n- Then, I checked if starting with \"s\" mattered\n- Eventually, I realized the rule seems to be extremely specific to those two exact words\n\nSo my final submission is that the rule requires the item to be exactly \"samba\" or \"salsa\" - nothing else.\n\nWould you like me to confirm my final guess?"
