The pattern I'm noticing is that each pair consists of an artist's name and the title of one of their most well-known songs.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before:\n\n\"U2\" and \"\"One\"\"\n\nThis pair follows the same structure as the previous examples, with the artist's name and the title of one of their iconic songs."

The item must be a pair, with the artist's name and a song title.\n2. The artist and song title must be a popular or iconic pairing - the examples feature famous musicians and their hit songs.\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the final rule is:\n\nThe valid items must be pairs of a music artist's name and the title of one of their famous/popular songs."
