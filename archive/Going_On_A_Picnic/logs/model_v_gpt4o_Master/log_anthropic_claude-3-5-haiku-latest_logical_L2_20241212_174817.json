The croissant is sweet, baked, and has a folded/layered structure like some previous accepted items, so it will help me probe the rule's boundaries.\n\nI'm curious to see how the game master will respond to this specific item, as it seems to share characteristics with both accepted and rejected items."

The shape appears to be the critical characteristic that determines acceptability.\n\nMy final guess is: The rule is \"You can bring sweet, baked goods that are round or circular in shape.\"\n\nThis hypothesis explains most of the accepted and rejected examples and provides a consistent principle that matches the observed pattern."
