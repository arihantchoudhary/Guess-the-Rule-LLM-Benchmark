That way, I can gather more information to try and discern the underlying principle.\n\nSo my response would be:\n\n\"Hmm, okay, let me try a new guess - could I bring a 'phaser' to the game? And if you don't mind, could you provide a few more examples of items that fit the rule? That would really help me understand the pattern better.\"\n\nHow's that? I tried to make a new guess, but also requested more examples since I'm still uncertain about the full scope of the rule. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions!"

This seems to fit the pattern of the previous examples.\n\nI think I'm getting closer to understanding the rule, but I'd like to ask for one more example just to confirm my understanding:\n\n\"Could you please provide one more example of an item that would be allowed under this rule?
