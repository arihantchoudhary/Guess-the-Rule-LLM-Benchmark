Output exactly one lambda function which outputs "True" or "False" according to some creative rule. The function should be aptly named. Then you should assign generated_fn to the function you create. This is executable code, so do not add any other uncommented explanatory text. Do NOT add grave markers for the code block. You should be defining a function using the "def" python keyword, and then assigning generated_fn to that function, in the locals dict. Do NOT use the "lambda" keyword--instead, use "def". Your function MUST match the signature in the examples (exactly ONE string input and a boolean ouput). Then have a line with "pass". Do NOT repeat any of the examples, or rephrase any of their code--instead, create original functions. Your function should have a fairly even split of True/False return values over a standard lexicon of lowercase English words.
