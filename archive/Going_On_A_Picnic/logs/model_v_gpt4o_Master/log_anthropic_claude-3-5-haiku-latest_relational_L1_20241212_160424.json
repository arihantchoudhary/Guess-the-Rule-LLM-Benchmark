Let me revise my guess:\n\nRevised Rule Guess: The items must have a specific number of syllables, likely 2 syllables.\n\nThe examples \"Lion\", \"Zebra\", and \"Giraffe\" all have 2 syllables. Although \"Elephant\" breaks this pattern, I'm confident the 2-syllable rule is the most likely explanation based on the limited information provided.\n\nIf I'm incorrect, I would appreciate learning the actual rule to understand the pattern I missed."
