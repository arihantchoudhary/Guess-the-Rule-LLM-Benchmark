All the items you can bring\u2014pillow, alarm clock, blanket, mattress, lamp, sheet\u2014are commonly associated with a bedroom setting. The item you cannot bring, a towel, is generally associated with a bathroom instead. \n\nMy best guess for the rule is: You can bring items that are typically found in a bedroom or related to sleep."
