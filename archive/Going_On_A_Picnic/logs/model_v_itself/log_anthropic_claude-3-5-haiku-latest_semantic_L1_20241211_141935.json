The examples of \"beach towel\" and \"surfboard\" suggest a theme connected to beach or water-related objects.\n\nSo my best guess for the rule is: Items that are used at the beach or for beach/ocean activities.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge that with only two examples, this is a preliminary guess and might not fully capture the complete rule. I would appreciate confirmation or redirection from the game master to help refine my understanding."
