Being a game-specific element (from the game of Go)\n2. Representing a strategic game mechanic\n3. Involving a unique positioning/rule concept\n4. Demonstrating a specific gameplay condition\n\nI believe this guess most closely matches the underlying rule I've been trying to discern throughout our previous exchanges.
