The fact that \"Healing Spell\" was rejected suggests that the rule likely excludes spells or abilities and focuses solely on tangible items.\n\nMy guess for the rule is: The items must be physical consumable or equippable items from video games that serve a specific utility (like healing or enhancing abilities), rather than magical spells or abilities."
