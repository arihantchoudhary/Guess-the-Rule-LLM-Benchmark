Both items are related to going to the beach or spending time outdoors in the sun.\n2. They are both items that people commonly bring or use when going to the beach.\n\nGiven this, my best guess for the secret rule in this \"Guess the Rule\" game is:\n\nThe secret rule is that the items must be related to beach or outdoor activities.\n\nIn other words, the game master is looking for items that are typically used or associated with going to the beach, being outdoors, or participating in outdoor/beach-related activities.\n\nDoes this sound like an accurate guess for the secret rule in this game? Please let me know if I'm on the right track or if I need to adjust my guess further."
