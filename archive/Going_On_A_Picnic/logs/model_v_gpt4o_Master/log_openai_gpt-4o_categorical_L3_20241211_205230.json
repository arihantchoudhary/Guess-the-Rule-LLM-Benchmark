However, \"perception\" contradicts the initial hypothesis because it both starts with a consonant and ends with a vowel but cannot be brought to the game. Therefore, the rule might involve another characteristic.\n\nTo test this, I'll make a new guess:\nCan \"motivation\" be brought to the game?"

The ones that could not be brought \u2014 \"analysis,\" \"wisdom,\" \"insight,\" and \"perception\" \u2014 are also abstract but may not fit the same pattern.\n\nThe rule might be that you can bring attributes that are involved in the creative process or imaginative thinking, which aligns with concepts that are often linked with the right hemisphere of the brain, as opposed to purely analytical or conclusively reasoned traits.\n\nSo, my best guess for the secret rule is: You can bring items that are abstract concepts associated with creativity and imagination."
