However, to test and refine my hypothesis, I'll try a different type of sporting item with a distinct use.\n\n\"Can I bring a hockey stick?\"\n\nMy reasoning:\n- It's a long, straight sporting implement\n- Used in an athletic activity\n- Different from previous examples\n- Has a similar elongated structure\n\nThis guess will help me determine if the rule is about the physical form (long, straight) or something more specific about sporting equipment."

The key commonality seems to be that these are all sporting equipment with a specific elongated shape.\n\nI want to test this hypothesis with a strategic guess that's different from previous examples:\n\"Can I bring a fishing rod?\"\n\nMy reasoning:\n- It's sporting/athletic equipment\n- Long and straight\n- Used in a specific sporting activity\n- Distinct from the previous examples\n- Matches the pattern of elongated sporting tools\n\nThis guess will help me further confirm or refine my understanding of the rule."
