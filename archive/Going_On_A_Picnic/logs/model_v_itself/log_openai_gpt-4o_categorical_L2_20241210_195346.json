One pattern that stands out is that all the items you are allowed to bring start with a letter that appears in the word \"basil\" or \"Tomatoes\". \n\nHere's a closer look:\n- Tomatoes: T, o, m, a, t, o, e, s\n- basil: b, a, s, i, l\n\nItems you could bring: \n- Parsley: p contains letters from \"Tomatoes\".\n- Cilantro: c contains letters from \"basil\".\n- Oregano: o, g, and n contain letters from \"Tomatoes\".\n- Thyme: t and e contain letters from \"Tomatoes\".\n- Mint: m, i, n, and t contain letters from \"Tomatoes\" and \"basil\".\n\nSince \"olives\" was not allowed and none of its letters are exclusively part of \"basil\" or \"Tomatoes\", it confirms the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: You can bring items whose names are comprised of letters found in the words \"basil\" or \"Tomatoes\"."
