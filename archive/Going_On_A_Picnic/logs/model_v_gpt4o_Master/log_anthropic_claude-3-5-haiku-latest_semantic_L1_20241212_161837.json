This will help me explore whether the rule is about broader water/ocean/beach connections.\nGame Master: Yes, you can bring sea salt.\n\nThis continues to support my hypothesis about a water/beach/ocean-related rule. The successful inclusion of \"sea salt\" suggests the rule might be quite broad and not limited strictly to physical equipment or activities.\n\nTo further explore this, I'll try another somewhat tangential guess:\n\n\"Seashell\"\n\nThis is a natural object directly associated with beaches and oceans, which will help me understand if the rule encompasses physical items found in marine environments."
