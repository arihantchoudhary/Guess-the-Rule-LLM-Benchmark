The examples seem quite different (a TikTok dance prop and an ALS Ice Bucket Challenge bucket), which makes it challenging to identify a clear pattern.\n\nHowever, I notice both are related to viral internet/social media trends or challenges. So my best initial guess might be: \"An item associated with a viral internet/social media phenomenon or challenge\"\n\nBut I would really need more context or additional examples to feel more certain about the rule. Could you provide more information or examples to help me narrow down my understanding?"
