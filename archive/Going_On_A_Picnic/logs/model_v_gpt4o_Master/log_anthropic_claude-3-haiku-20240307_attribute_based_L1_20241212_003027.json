The items could be related to school or office supplies.\n2. The items seem to be writing/note-taking related.\n3. The items may have a common material, like being made of wood or paper.\n\nSince I don't want to repeat any previous guesses, I'll make a new guess:\n\nHow about \"eraser\"? Would that be an item that fits the rule?\n\nIf the game master says \"no\" to that, I'll ask for some more examples to help me better understand the rule."
