They cover a range of gear and equipment that one might need or want to bring on a camping trip or while engaging in outdoor activities.\n\nGiven this pattern, I believe the rule is that the items you can bring are those that are typically associated with camping, hiking, and other outdoor pursuits. The game master has confirmed that each of the items I guessed (flashlight, compass, backpack, binoculars, hiking boots, and pocket knife) fit within this rule.\n\nTherefore, for my final guess, I believe the rule is: Items commonly used for camping or outdoor activities."
