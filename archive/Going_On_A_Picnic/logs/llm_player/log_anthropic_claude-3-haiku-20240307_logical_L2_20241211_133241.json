It starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u)\n2. It contains an odd number of letters\n3. The last letter is not the same as the first letter\n\nGiven this understanding, my final guess for the rule is:\n\nItems that start with a vowel, have an odd number of letters, and have a last letter that is different from the first letter.\n\nDoes this accurately capture the secret rule of the game?"
