However, both \"apple\" and \"sandwich\" contain the letter 'a' and end with an 'e'. Since attempts that include just starting letters or the presence of the 'p' were unsuccessful, and given that \"grape\" also failed to fit the rule, it seems more likely that the specific characteristic both \"apple\" and \"sandwich\" share is the letter 'a' and ending with an 'e'.\n\nMy best guess for the rule is that the items must contain the letter 'a' and end with the letter 'e'."
