The items must be star-related (star shape, star theme, or containing \"star\" in the name)\n2. The items must have a connection to space/celestial objects (lunar, star, astronomical references)\n3. The items must involve a specific shape (star-shaped, round like a moon)\n\nHowever, with only two examples, I cannot be completely certain. I would need to ask for clarification or more examples to confidently determine the exact rule. My current best guess is that there's a connection to stars, astronomy, or celestial themes."
