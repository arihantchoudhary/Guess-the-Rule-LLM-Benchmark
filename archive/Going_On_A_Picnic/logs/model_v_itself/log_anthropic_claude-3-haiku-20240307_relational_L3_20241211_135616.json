The items are all musical works or instruments associated with classical music.\n\nSo for a new guess that hasn't been mentioned:\n\"Moonlight Sonata\"\n\nThis is a famous classical piano sonata composed by Beethoven, which aligns with the pattern of the examples provided.\n\nI'll hold off on trying to guess the full rule just yet, as I want to see if the game master provides any additional examples first to help solidify my understanding. Getting more information could help me make a more confident guess at the overall rule."

The game master has validated my guesses of \"Moonlight Sonata\" and \"Symphony No. 5 by Beethoven\", further reinforcing this interpretation of the rule.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the full rule is:\n\nThe rule is that the items allowed are famous, iconic works of classical music, including both individual compositions as well as the musical instruments typically associated with classical music."
