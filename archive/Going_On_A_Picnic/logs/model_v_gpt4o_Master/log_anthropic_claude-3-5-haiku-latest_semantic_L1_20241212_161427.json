By asking this, I can further confirm or potentially refine my understanding of the rule."

Every single item we've tested fits this category:\n- Beach towel\n- Sunscreen\n- Swimming goggles\n- Surfboard\n- Beach umbrella\n- Beach ball\n- Snorkel\n- Beach sandals/flip-flops\n\n2. These items span different types of beach/summer accessories:\n- Protective items (sunscreen)\n- Clothing/footwear (beach sandals)\n- Swimming/water equipment (goggles, snorkel)\n- Beach leisure items (beach ball, umbrella)\n- Beach-specific tools/equipment (towel, surfboard)\n\n3. The consistent theme is they are all fundamentally connected to beach, water, or summer recreational activities.\n\nI am extremely confident this is the secret rule. Each item strategically tested has confirmed this hypothesis, and no contradictory examples have emerged."
