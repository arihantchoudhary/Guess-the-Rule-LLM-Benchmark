My guesses of items with two or more words in the name (\"Eiffel Tower\", \"Golden Gate Bridge\", \"Statue of Liberty\", \"Niagara Falls\", \"The Great Wall of China\") were all rejected.\n3. My guess of \"Cherry Blossom\", which has two words but is a compound noun, was also rejected.\n\nBased on the pattern of responses, I believe the rule is not about the number of words in the name, but rather something specific to the examples provided.\n\nMy best guess for the rule is:\n\nThe items that can be brought to the picnic are proper nouns that refer to specific, well-known geographic locations or celestial bodies.\n\n\"Boat\", \"Mississippi\", \"Rocket\", and \"Moon\" all fit this pattern, while my other guesses (Eiffel Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, etc.) do not.\n\nTherefore, my final guess is:\nThe rule is that you can only bring proper nouns referring to specific, well-known geographic locations or celestial bodies to the picnic.\n\nGame Master, is my final guess correct?"
