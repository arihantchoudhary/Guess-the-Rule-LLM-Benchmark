The items could be made from or contain some kind of dough or pastry.\n\nSince I don't want to repeat any previous guesses, I will make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before:\n\nGuess: Can I bring \"muffin\" to the game?\n\nDoes \"muffin\" fit the secret rule the game master has in mind?

The items are all savory or semi-sweet (rather than purely sweet desserts).\n\nSince I don't want to repeat any previous guesses, I'll make a new one:\n\nGuess: Can I bring \"croissant\" to the game?\n\nThis fits the pattern I've observed so far, as croissants are a type of baked, dough-based pastry that is not purely sweet. Let me know if \"croissant\" is allowed under the secret rule."

Does \"scone\" fit the secret rule?\n\nIf not, I think I'd like to ask the game master for another example or two to help me narrow down the rule further. The more examples I can get, the better I can analyze the pattern and make an accurate guess."

They are not purely sweet desserts.\n\nGiven that, I will make a new guess:\n\nGuess: Can I bring \"biscotti\" to the game?\n\nBiscotti are a type of Italian biscuit-like cookie that is baked twice to make it crunchy. They are often savory or semi-sweet, fitting the pattern of the other allowed items.\n\nDoes \"biscotti\" fit the secret rule the game master has in mind? If not, I'd be happy to ask for another example to help me refine my understanding of the rule."
