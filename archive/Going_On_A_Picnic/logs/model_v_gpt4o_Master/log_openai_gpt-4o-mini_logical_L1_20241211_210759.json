Conversely, the items you guessed and were denied (\"bowl,\" \"cup,\" \"napkin,\" \"fork,\" \"blanket,\" \"shoe,\" \"spoon,\" \"key\") often relate to specific categories or uses that might not align with whatever defining trait is shared by \"pickle,\" \"plate,\" \"pillow,\" and \"passport.\"\n\nConsidering this, one potential interpretation of the rule could be that the items allowed are ones commonly associated with movement or travel, or items that are generally more personal or compact, while those disallowed are typically larger, more functional, or classified as utensils or parts of clothing.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my guess for the rule is that an item must be commonly associated with travel or hospitality in order to be included. Therefore, my final guess is that you can bring \"luggage.\""
