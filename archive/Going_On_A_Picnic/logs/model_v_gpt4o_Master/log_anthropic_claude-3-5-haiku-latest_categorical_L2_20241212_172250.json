I notice the current allowed items are \"yoga mat\" and \"yoga block\" - both start with the letter \"y\" and are related to yoga.\n\nSo I'll ask: \"Can I bring a yardstick?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that this item:\n1. Starts with \"y\" like the previous allowed items\n2. Is a completely different type of object from the yoga equipment\n3. Will help me test whether the rule might be related to the first letter of the item\n\nThis guess will help me understand if the rule is about the first letter, or if it's still specifically about yoga equipment."

If \"y\" is part of the rule, this will help confirm that\n4.

It's a different type of object (food container) from the previous guesses\n3. It has a connection to the previously allowed items through the \"yo-\" sound\n4.

It's closely related to the initially allowed items \"yoga mat\" and \"yoga block\"\n2. It's another piece of yoga/exercise equipment\n3. It will help me understand if the rule is specifically about yoga-related items or something more nuanced\n\nThis guess is strategic because:\n- It's similar to previous allowed items\n- It tests whether the rule is about yoga equipment specifically\n- It introduces a slightly different type of yoga equipment (a ball vs. a mat or block)\n\nI'm hoping this will provide more clarity about the underlying rule."

Allowed items so far:\n- \"yoga mat\" \u2713\n- \"yoga block\" \u2713\n- \"yoga ball\" \u2713\n\n2. Rejected items include:\n- \"jump rope\" (not yoga-related)\n- \"foam roller\" (not yoga-related)\n- \"yardstick\" (not yoga-related)\n- \"yellow marker\" (not yoga-related)\n- \"yogurt container\" (not a yoga item)\n\nThe consistent pattern seems to be that the item must:\n- Directly contain the word \"yoga\" in its name\n- Be a piece of equipment or object associated with yoga practice\n\nThis rule explains why \"yoga ball\" was allowed while other \"y\" items or fitness equipment were not.\n\nMy final guess is that the rule is specifically about items with \"[Yoga] + [Object]\" naming structure."
