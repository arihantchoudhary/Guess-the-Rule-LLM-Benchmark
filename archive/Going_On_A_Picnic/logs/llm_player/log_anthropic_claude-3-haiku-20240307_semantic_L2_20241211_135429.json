Based on the examples allowed (\"chess piece\", \"dice\", \"playing cards\", \"game board\", \"Monopoly game\") and the ones that were not allowed (\"puzzle\", \"video game console\", \"jigsaw puzzle\"), I believe the rule is:\n\nThe items allowed are traditional or analog games, game boards, and game pieces, but not puzzles or digital/electronic games.\n\nDoes this sound like the correct rule? If so, I'm ready to provide a final guess."
