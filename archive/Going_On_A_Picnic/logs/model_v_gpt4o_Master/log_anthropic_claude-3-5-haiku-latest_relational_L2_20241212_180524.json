All items are breakfast-related\n2. They represent common breakfast foods (pancakes, bacon, toast, cereal)\n3. They represent common breakfast drinks (orange juice, coffee, milk, tea)\n4. Other breakfast-related items like maple syrup, eggs, and a spoon were rejected\n\nThe rule seems to require not just being a breakfast item, but being a standard, classic breakfast item that would commonly appear together on a breakfast table or menu.\n\nTherefore, my final rule guess is: \"You can bring classic breakfast food or drink items that would typically be served together during a traditional breakfast.\""
