Furthermore, the name of the item should include at least one letter from each of the words 'peace', 'joy', and 'serenity'. The item itself must be intangible, representing a positive emotion or state of mind that is commonly associated with outdoor gatherings. The item's name should not contain any 'double letters,' and when spelled backward, it should form a different but valid English word. Additionally, the name of the item, when its letters are rearranged, must form the name of a country in the world, and the item should evoke a sense of unity or togetherness. Finally, the total numeric value of the letters in the item's name (A=1, B=2, etc.) should be a prime number, signifying its uniqueness and importance.",
