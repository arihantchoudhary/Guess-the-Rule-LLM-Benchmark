            "content": "Okay, based on the examples provided (utility belt, superhero cape, and mask), I will make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before:\n\n\"Utility watch\"\n\nA utility watch is a common accessory for superheroes and crime-fighters, as it can have various gadgets and functions built-in, similar to a utility belt. This seems to fit the superhero/crime-fighting theme that the previous examples have suggested.\n\nLet's see if the game master approves this guess."

Please let me know if I have correctly deduced the rule."

The rule is: Only items that are typically associated with or symbolized in popular superhero comics can be brought to the picnic.\n\nWell done in deducing the rule based on the examples provided.
