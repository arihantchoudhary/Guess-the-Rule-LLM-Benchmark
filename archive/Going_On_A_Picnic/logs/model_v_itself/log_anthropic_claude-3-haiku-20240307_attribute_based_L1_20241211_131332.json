This suggests the rule might be related to allowing only food items to be brought to the game.\n\nRather than making another guess, I think I'll ask the game master for more examples to help me better understand the rule.\n\nGame Master, could you please provide me with a few more examples of items that fit the rule? That would really help me narrow down the secret rule."

This suggests the rule is specifically focused on allowing participants to bring edible food items to the game.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule is:\n\nThe rule allows only FOOD ITEMS to be brought to the game.\n\nHow did I do?
