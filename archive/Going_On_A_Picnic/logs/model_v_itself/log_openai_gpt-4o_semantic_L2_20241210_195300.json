Each item mentioned relates to a well-known animated series or its elements (e.g., Scooby Snacks from \"Scooby-Doo,\" Acme Anvils from the cartoons featuring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, Flintstone Vitamins from \"The Flintstones,\" Looney Tunes Lunchboxes from \"Looney Tunes,\" Jetson's Spaceships from \"The Jetsons,\" and Tom and Jerry Cheese from \"Tom and Jerry\").\n\nSo, my best guess for the rule is: You can bring items that are related to classic animated television shows or their associated characters."
