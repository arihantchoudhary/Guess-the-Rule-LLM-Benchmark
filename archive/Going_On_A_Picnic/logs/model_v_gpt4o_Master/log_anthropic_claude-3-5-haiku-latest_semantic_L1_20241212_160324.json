However, I'll make an educated guess that the rule might be:\n\n\"Things you would typically bring to the beach or use while at the beach\"\n\nMy reasoning:\n- \"Beach towel\" is a direct beach-related item\n- \"Sunscreen\" is also specifically used for beach/sun protection\n- Both items are practical objects associated with beach activities\n\nThe rule seems to be related to beach-related items or things you would pack/use when going to the beach.\n\nWould you like me to confirm this guess?"
