Conversely, items like \"Disco ball\" and \"Grease,\" which refer more to experiences or media rather than distinct fashion items, were rejected.\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule is: **You can bring clothing or fashion items specifically from the 1960s and 1970s pop culture, especially those that represent key trends or styles from that time.**"
