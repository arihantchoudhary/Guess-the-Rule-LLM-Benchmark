The examples given all fit this theme, and I believe this is the most accurate summary of the secret rule for this \"Guess the Rule Games\" challenge."

You were able to correctly identify the secret rule based on the examples I provided. The items that can be brought to the picnic are abstract concepts and ideals that were mentioned in the speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., such as \"freedom\", \"justice\", \"equality\", \"compassion\", and \"mercy\". Thank you for playing!"
