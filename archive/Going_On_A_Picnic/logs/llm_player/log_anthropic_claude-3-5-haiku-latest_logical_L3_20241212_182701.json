Furthermore, the item's name, when spelled backward, should not form a valid English word. The total number of letters in the name should be divisible by 3, and the item itself must be a tangible object associated with capturing or displaying images. The item's name should not contain the letters 'z' or 'q', and the item should not require electricity or batteries to function. Additionally, the name of the item should rhyme with a type of fruit and must be a single word noun. Finally, the name of the item, when split into individual letters, should form the first name of a renowned figure in the field of photography.",
