This suggests the rule may be a bit more specific than just general desk items.\n\nOkay, let me take another shot at guessing the rule based on the examples provided so far:\n\nPlayer: The rule allows items that are desk-related accessories or organizational tools, specifically for writing instruments, papers, and other small office supplies, but does not include larger desk furnishings or electronics.\n\nDoes this updated guess accurately capture the rule, Game Master?\nGame Master: Correct! You have successfully guessed the rule.
