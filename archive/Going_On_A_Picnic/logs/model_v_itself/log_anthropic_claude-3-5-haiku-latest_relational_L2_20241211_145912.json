The two examples given are both sports: soccer (a team sport played with a ball) and tennis (an individual or doubles racket sport).\n\nThe rule might be something like:\n- Only sports can be mentioned\n- Or items related to sports/athletic activities\n- Or words that represent a specific category of physical activities\n\nHowever, with only two examples, this is a very preliminary guess. I would need more context or additional examples to make a more confident and precise determination of the underlying rule."
