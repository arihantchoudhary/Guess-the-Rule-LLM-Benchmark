The items that are accepted generally have a connection to specific locations or distinct natural settings (like \"cherry blossoms\" representing a type of flower and \"mountain stream\" depicting a geographical feature).\n\nHowever, there appears to be a pattern where accepted entries consist of certain types of flora or geographical features with a specific descriptor, while others with less specificity or broader terms are rejected. \n\nThus, my final guess for the rule is: \"You can bring items that include a specific natural descriptor associated with a geographic feature or plant that reflects a certain location. Specifically, items must consist of a specific type of flora or a unique natural element related to a defined landscape.\" \n\nTo confirm: Can I bring \"meadow daisies\"?"
