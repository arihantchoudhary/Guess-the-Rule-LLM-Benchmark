Another possible pattern could be that the items have two syllables, although they can vary in length (as seen with \"cereal\" which is not as short as most fruits listed), or that these items are commonly consumed foods. While some guesses were incorrectly focused on length, the consistent element is that they have been edible items, mostly fruits. \n\nTherefore, my best guess for the rule is:\n\nYou can bring items that are edible, specifically fruits or commonly consumed foods."
