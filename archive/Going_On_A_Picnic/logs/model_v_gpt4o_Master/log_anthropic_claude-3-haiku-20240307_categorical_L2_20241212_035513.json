However, if the game master confirms cocoa nibs are allowed, then I'd like to take another shot at guessing the rule.\n\nCould the rule be that the allowed items are common cocoa/chocolate-based baking ingredients? The examples so far include things like cocoa powder, which seemed to fit, and now cocoa nibs would also align with that potential rule.\n\nPlease let me know if I'm on the right track with this new guess and potential rule, or if you have any other suggestions.

The examples cover a mix of dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, etc.) as well as some wet/liquid ingredients (eggs, butter, vanilla extract).\n\n2. The items seem to be limited to common baking-related ingredients, rather than general cooking ingredients.\n\n3. The game master did not allow the more general cooking ingredient of ground black pepper, reinforcing that the focus is on baking-specific items.\n\n4. The inclusion of cocoa-based ingredients like cocoa powder and cocoa nibs suggests the rule is broad enough to encompass common baking ingredients beyond just dry staples.\n\nSo in summary, my final guess for the rule is:\n\nThe allowed items are common baking ingredients, including both dry and wet/liquid components typically used in baking.\n\nPlease let me know if this final guess accurately captures the rule, or if you have any other feedback. I want to make sure I understand the full scope of the rule before the game ends.\nGame Master: Excellent work! You have correctly guessed the rule. The allowed items are common baking ingredients, including both dry and wet/liquid components typically used in baking.\n\nCongratulations on winning the \"Guess the Rule\" game! You demonstrated strong analytical skills and the ability to iteratively test and refine your hypothesis based on the provided examples. Your final guess accurately captured the full scope of the rule. Well done!"
