For example, items that tend to be used in savory dishes (like \"carrot,\" \"broccoli,\" or \"zucchini\") fit the rule, while those that are commonly used as sweets (like \"banana,\" \"grape,\" or \"strawberry\") do not. \n\nThus, my final guess is: **The rule is that only savory fruits and vegetables are allowed, while sweet fruits or dessert-like items are not permitted.**"
