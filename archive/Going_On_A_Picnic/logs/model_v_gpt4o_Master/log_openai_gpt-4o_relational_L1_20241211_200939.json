Each of the words given either contains an \"a\" or an \"n\" or both. \n\nWhile \"apple\" includes the letter \"a,\" \"strawberry\" includes the letters \"a\" and \"n,\" \"banana\" contains both, and \"sunflower\" contains the letter \"n.\"\n\nTherefore, my best guess for the secret rule is that the item must contain the letter \"a\" or \"n.\""
