Read the following function code, and then read the user's guess. You will determine whether or not the guess accurately describes the function (it is okay if the guess is succinct, as long as it is correct). The user is playing a guessing game, where they receive examples, along with "True" or "False" labels depending on what the rule function evaluates to on each example. The user clearly knows that it is some kind of lexical function (acts on string manipulation), so their guess must be more specific than this. They don't need to guess the exact implementation of the function (that doesn't matter), but they should be accurately describing what its result is, in simple English. It is okay if they imply the rule is a kind of filter (even though the user sees both True and False examples); it is also okay if the user gives a synonym / equivalent explanation that demonstrates they understand how the rule behaves. You may succinctly explain your thoughts. At the end of your response should be a single word, either "YES" or "NO" in all caps (no punctuation).
