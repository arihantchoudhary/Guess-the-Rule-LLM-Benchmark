Dance performance clothing (shoes, skirts, dresses, leotards, bodices)\n2. Dance accessories (fans, castanets)\n3. Covering multiple dance styles (Ballet, Flamenco, Tap)\n\nThe common thread connecting all these items is that they are directly associated with dance performance, dance attire, or dance accessories from various dance traditions. Every single item is unquestionably connected to dance in some meaningful way."
