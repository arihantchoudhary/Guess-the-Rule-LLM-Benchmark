These appear to be items related to going to the beach or outdoor activities.\n\n2. Since the examples are beach-related, I will make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before:\n\n\"Sunglasses\"\n\nSunglasses are an item that would be commonly brought to the beach or other outdoor activities, just like sunscreen and a beach towel.\n\n3. I will wait for the game master's response to see if \"sunglasses\" fits the rule or not.
