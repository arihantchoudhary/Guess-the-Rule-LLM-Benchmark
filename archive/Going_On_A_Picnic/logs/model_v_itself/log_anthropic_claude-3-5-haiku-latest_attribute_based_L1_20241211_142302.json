I'll ask:\n\n\"Can I bring a ruler?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that a ruler is also:\n- An educational/school-related item\n- A flat object\n- Used for writing, measuring, or academic tasks\n\nThis will help me test whether the rule is about study/school items or something about flatness or shape."

I'll strategically ask about an item that tests whether the rule is about educational/school items or something else.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a compass?\" \n\nMy reasoning:\n- A compass is an educational tool used in math/geometry\n- It's related to school/studying\n- It's a tool with a specific purpose\n- It's somewhat flat/compact\n\nThis guess will help me further explore whether the rule is about educational items, tools, or something else.

However, I want to test this hypothesis strategically by choosing an item that will help me confirm or refute this potential rule.\n\nI'll ask: \"Can I bring a apple?\"\n\nMy reasoning is that this item:\n- Starts with a vowel sound (unlike the previous examples)\n- Tests whether the first letter/sound matters\n- Is something completely different from the previous school/writing items\n\nThis will help me understand if the rule is about the starting sound/letter or if there's another pattern I haven't detected yet."

Textbook (T)\n  2. Pencil (P)\n  3. Notebook (N)\n  4. Ruler (R)\n  5. Compass (C)\n\n- Disallowed item:\n  1. Apple (starts with a vowel sound - A)\n\nThe key seems to be the initial consonant sound, not just the letter. This would explain why items from different categories (school supplies, tools) are allowed, as long as they begin with a consonant sound.\n\nI'm confident this is the secret rule, and I'm making this as my final guess about the rule in the game."
