So my guess is that the rule is something like \"Bring legendary, mythical, or divine items to the game.\"\n\nIf I'm still off base, I'll ask the game master for some more examples to help me better understand the rule."

If not, I'll ask for some more examples to help me narrow it down further."

Does this item also fit the rule for what can be brought to the game?\n\nIf my guess of the rule is correct, and \"Pandora's Box\" is an allowed item, then I believe I have a good grasp of the underlying principle here. Please let me know if I'm on the right track!"

Well done!"
