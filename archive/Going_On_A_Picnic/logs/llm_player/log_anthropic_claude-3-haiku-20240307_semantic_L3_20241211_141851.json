It could be a rule related to items found in the ocean or from a marine/aquatic environment.\n\nIn that case, I'll make a new guess that hasn't been mentioned before:\n\nGuess: Can I bring a \"seashell\"?\n\n2. Alternatively, the rule could be related to items that are natural, organic, or from nature.\n\nIf that's the case, I'll ask the game master for more examples to help me better understand the rule:\n\nCan you please provide a few more examples of items that fit the rule?\n\nI want to avoid repeating previous guesses and try to really grasp the underlying logic here before making another attempt. More examples from you would be very helpful."

Please let me know if I can bring a sand dollar to the game.\n\nIf the game master confirms that a sand dollar is allowed, then I feel confident that I have correctly deduced the underlying rule of the game.
