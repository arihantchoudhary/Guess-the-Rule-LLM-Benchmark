Based on the examples provided by the game master - \"Dolls\" and \"Doughnuts\" - I believe the secret rule is:\n\nThe items must start with the letter \"D\".\n\nThe two examples both start with the letter \"D\" - \"Dolls\" and \"Doughnuts\". This suggests that the secret rule is that the items must begin with the letter \"D\".\n\nTherefore, my final guess for the secret rule in this \"Guess the Rule Games\" is:\n\nThe items must start with the letter \"D\"."
