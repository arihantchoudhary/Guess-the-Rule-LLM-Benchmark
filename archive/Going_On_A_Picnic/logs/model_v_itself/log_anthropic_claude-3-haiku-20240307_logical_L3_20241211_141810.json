The name satisfies the secret rule.\n\nAh, I think I've figured out the secret rule now. Based on the examples and the responses so far, it seems the secret rule is that the items must have a curved or oval-like shape. The acceptable items are \"Ezyoo\", \"Ovalpad\", \"Ovalpen\", and \"Ellipsepad\", all of which have a non-rectangular, curved geometry.\n\nLet me summarize my understanding of the secret rule:\n\nThe secret rule is that the item must have a curved or oval-like shape, rather than a rigid, angular, or rectangular shape.\n\nDoes this correctly capture the secret rule? Please let me know if I'm on the right track or if I'm still missing something."
