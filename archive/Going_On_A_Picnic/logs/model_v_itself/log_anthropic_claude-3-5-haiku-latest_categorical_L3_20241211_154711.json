However, I notice that the two examples (\"Mother's Little Helper\" and \"brown sugar\") are both multi-word phrases, one of which could be considered a euphemism or slang term.\n\nMy best guess is that the rule might involve:\n- Accepting multi-word phrases\n- Potentially including terms with metaphorical or slang meanings\n- Possibly related to household items or food ingredients\n\nWithout more context or examples, this is a tentative guess. I would appreciate if the game master could provide more information to help me narrow down the specific rule."
