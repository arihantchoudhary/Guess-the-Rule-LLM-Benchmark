I'll ask:\n\n\"Can I bring a 'crown'?\"\n\nMy reasoning:\n- It's a medieval/fantasy themed item\n- It starts with a consonant\n- It's different from the previous weapons and equipment\n- Helps me gather more information about the potential rule\n\nI'm particularly curious to see if the rule relates to:\n1.

Each approved item - sword, goblet, shield, lance, helmet, crown, flute, circle - contains the letter \"L\"\n2. This pattern holds true across:\n   - Different types of objects (weapons, equipment, musical instruments, shapes)\n   - Different themes (medieval/fantasy and beyond)\n   - Words with \"L\" in different positions (start, middle, end)\n3. The variety of items suggests the rule is specifically about letter composition, not object type or starting letter\n\nTherefore, I am declaring my final guess: To be allowed in the game, an item must have the letter \"L\" in its spelling."
